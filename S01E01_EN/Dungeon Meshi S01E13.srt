00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,670
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,301
DRAGON BONELESS HAM

3
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:35,095
There's so much meat to process,
I don't know if we can consume it all.

4
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,756
There you are.

5
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,677
What's with your form?

6
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,764
I thought I assigned you the task
of searching for His Majesty.

7
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,726
I don't recall permitting you
to take a break.

8
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,817
What was that noise?

9
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,070
Looks like the sword
I had propped up fell over.

10
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,781
You should tie it in place.

11
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,118
Falin?

12
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,037
Marcille.

13
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,832
Where did Falin go?

14
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,334
Huh?

15
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,170
Senshi, do you know
where Falin took off to?

16
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,339
I haven't seen anyone walk by.

17
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,592
What is it? Is something wrong?

18
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,220
Don't tell me…

19
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,432
she left through this window.

20
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,894
I'll go take a look outside.

21
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,354
Huh?

22
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,198
What the…

23
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,451
Falin!

24
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,704
Are you okay?

25
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,497
What happened--

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,377
What happened here?

27
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:35,132
Lord Delgal… I have to look for him.

28
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,384
Delgal? Who's that?

29
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:38,719
Everything…

30
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,638
Everything that exists on this earth,

31
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:48,228
every building, gold coin,
citizen, cattle, blood, flesh…

32
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:53,317
Even the grain of sand beneath your feet,

33
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:59,448
belongs to His Majesty, King Delgal.

34
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,745
You dirty thief.

35
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,248
I remember spotting you,

36
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,668
skulking inside the paintings.

37
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,212
<i>He remembers me?</i>

38
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,838
<i>The King?</i>

39
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,507
<i>Inside the paintings?</i>

40
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,677
Who are you? What is your purpose?

41
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,226
<i>He's the lord of the dungeon…</i>

42
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,645
<i>The lunatic magician!</i>

43
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,735
H-Hey, you! Step back!

44
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,028
Next time, I won't miss!

45
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,909
You damn usurpers!

46
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,120
Falin, can you get up?

47
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,287
Falin!

48
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,665
Shut up!

49
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,420
Laios!

50
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,172
What incredible strength.

51
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,925
What the hell is going on?

52
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,426
Is that guy an adventurer?

53
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,347
Huh? What's with the book?

54
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,432
I've got a really bad feeling about this.

55
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,727
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

56
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,688
Is it just me,
or is he chanting something?

57
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,358
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

58
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,943
This incantation…

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,447
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

60
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,324
<i>It's ancient magic!</i>

61
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,701
Devour!

62
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,254
<i>Explosive spells, defense magic,</i>

63
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,381
<i>none of that can halt this attack!</i>

64
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,757
<i>In that case…</i>

65
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,391
<i>I'll directly overwrite the spell!</i>

66
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,275
Cancel!

67
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,825
Cancel!

68
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,161
<i>This ancient magic…</i>

69
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,164
<i>I can understand and decipher it, but!</i>

70
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,837
<i>I can't keep up with it!</i>

71
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,343
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

72
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,349
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

73
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,611
A-Are you the maker of this dungeon?

74
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,864
I'd like to have a chat with--

75
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,136
No need to fear.

76
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,138
The traitors have gone.

77
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,393
His Majesty will return soon.

78
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,187
When he does,
let us hold a grand celebration.

79
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,774
Hey, Dragon.

80
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,779
This form must be inconvenient for you.

81
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,032
I'll provide you with a new one.

82
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,543
Do what needs to be done.

83
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,796
As you command.

84
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,217
Ow.

85
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,635
What's going on?

86
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,221
Hold on, I'll provide light.

87
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,560
What is this place?

88
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,146
Where did we fall from, anyway?

89
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,815
What the heck? Where's the exit--

90
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,068
What now?

91
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,612
I think the walls are closing in!

92
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,323
You've got to be kidding me! Dammit!

93
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,158
The exit! Search for an exit!

94
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,451
Where?!

95
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,827
Can't you magic us out of here?

96
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,079
Using what magic exactly?

97
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,714
<i>We're going to die.</i>

98
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,258
<i>It's not my first time dying,</i>

99
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,469
<i>but no one will find us
under these stones.</i>

100
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,930
<i>I finally reunited with Falin</i>

101
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,391
<i>and took a step closer
to unraveling the dungeon's mystery.</i>

102
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,977
<i>Now all of that is going to mean nothing!</i>

103
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,813
<i>I don't want to die like this!</i>

104
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,277
Marcille!

105
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,865
It's a hole! We can escape through here!

106
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,826
We don't know where it leads!

107
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,870
Anything's better than getting squashed!

108
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,373
Just hurry!

109
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,591
Where are we?

110
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,259
It's freezing!

111
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,263
Anyway, we've got to get out of here.

112
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,264
Not happening.

113
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,976
I can't even budge a finger.

114
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,770
You have to try.

115
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,855
If that guy finds us again…

116
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,698
<i>We're toast.</i>

117
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,296
T-They vanished.

118
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,925
Damn, it feels like
my head's about to explode.

119
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,179
Senshi, wake Laios up.

120
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,849
I'll scout around this area.

121
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,022
Get him!

122
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,858
Where did these bastards sneak in from?

123
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,693
There's a long-ears too!

124
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,028
-He went that way!
-You little!

125
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,197
Quiet!

126
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,615
What's the matter?

127
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,200
Moles, Captain.

128
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,994
How did they get in?

129
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,787
What were the guards doing?

130
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,748
We're not sure.

131
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,250
<i>The hole is sealed.</i>

132
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,710
Whatever.

133
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,378
A little man,

134
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,714
a depths-dweller,

135
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,217
a long-legs, and a long-ears!

136
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,886
Interesting.

137
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,598
I've never killed a long-ears before.
I'll handle it.

138
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,100
Give the little man to the dogs.

139
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,102
They're craving some entertainment.

140
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,520
Wait.

141
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:49,357
You are Chief Zon's sister, aren't you?

142
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,904
We have come to fulfill
our promise to your chief.

143
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,114
We ask that you treat us kindly.

144
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,867
How do you know that name?

145
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,952
Huh?

146
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,749
You're the vegetable seller!

147
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,501
You smelled different,
so we didn't recognize you!

148
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,005
What brings you all the way down here?

149
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,549
What promise did you make to our Chief?

150
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:17,510
I see.

151
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,347
So that's what happened.

152
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,434
I was curious why the Dragon
had disappeared all of a sudden.

153
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,812
I thank you on behalf of the Chief.

154
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,356
Prepare the concoction.

155
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,199
It's ready.

156
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,910
ORC CONCOCTION

157
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,055
U-Um…

158
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,933
I'm just…

159
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,310
out of…

160
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,437
magic…

161
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,571
H-Hey.

162
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,449
We were attacked by an elf magician.

163
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,452
Do you know anything about him?

164
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,787
You've encountered him?

165
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,666
He had brown skin and silver hair…

166
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,709
That's the one.

167
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,461
We don't know a lot about him.

168
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,215
He's been around
long before we settled here.

169
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,467
And it seems he's the one
governing this dungeon.

170
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:44,222
Whenever outsiders
excessively meddle with the dungeon,

171
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,224
that's when he shows up.

172
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,062
<i>He creates monsters,
controls them at will, alters the terrain,</i>

173
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,316
<i>and can kill any creature
by simply flipping through his book.</i>

174
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,736
The ruler of the dungeon…

175
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,737
That means…

176
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:03,241
we've caught the attention
of the lunatic magician!

177
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:04,576
That's no joke!

178
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,329
Damn, we've got to get out of here fast!

179
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,290
Was it Marcille's magic that lured him?

180
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,751
No, maybe it's because
we took down the Red Dragon.

181
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,629
He has a few monsters under his command,

182
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,507
and when you kill them,
you end up ticking him off.

183
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,634
So that's what my brother
was worried about,

184
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:26,014
and why he warned us not to mess
with the Red Dragon.

185
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,433
My brother is always right.

186
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,976
<i>That bastard!</i>

187
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:34,647
Once these two wake up,
they'll want to find Falin for sure.

188
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,150
But I have to make them give up somehow.

189
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,902
How?

190
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,403
Anything that does the trick!

191
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,738
We can burn Marcille's staff

192
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,157
or tell them we spotted Falin
heading to the surface.

193
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,577
Or that we should be content
after having Dragon meat.

194
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,538
So, you're proposing we deceive them?

195
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,998
I am!

196
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:55,543
Otherwise, these idiots
would never let it go!

197
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,838
If we go any deeper,
we're definitely going to get killed.

198
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,548
Do you want to become a part of the wall?

199
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,300
Because I sure don't!

200
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,935
I have no intention of joining them
just to end up dead.

201
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,562
Hey,

202
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,190
I want to go retrieve my stuff
that I left behind.

203
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,818
Could you show me the way?

204
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,655
No way.

205
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,574
I don't want the stench of spinelessness
rubbing off on me.

206
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,161
I ask you as well.

207
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,080
Please take him there.

208
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,208
He might be faint-hearted,
but he's not a bad fellow.

209
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,836
Senshi, aren't you coming with me?

210
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,464
One of us should stay with those two.

211
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,632
But…

212
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,472
You know I can't say no to you.

213
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,559
I'd rather not, but I'll show him the way.

214
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:00,775
<i>Damn it.</i>

215
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,446
<i>They're a bunch of fools,
every last one of them!</i>

216
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,906
Did you get separated from a companion?

217
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,742
Yeah.

218
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,371
The last we saw of her, she was lying
on the ground near the magician's feet.

219
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,749
It's tough to be hopeful about that.

220
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,586
That doesn't justify
lying to your friends.

221
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,173
Easy for someone on the outside to say.

222
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,050
No, forget I said that!

223
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,844
Behind you.

224
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,262
Huh?

225
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,102
Don't panic.

226
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,020
It's cold!

227
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,606
That's one of the city's residents.

228
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,193
The spirits here are still sane

229
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,945
and only appear when they want to be seen.

230
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,240
The routes they take are safe.

231
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,408
Let's follow.

232
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,367
Huh?

233
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,538
You better be right.

234
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,469
That's the place
we were at a little while ago.

235
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,138
The Red Dragon is gone.

236
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,975
It didn't resurrect, did it?

237
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:16,893
No.

238
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,979
The dogs aren't on high alert.

239
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,149
Either the magician made it disappear
or took it with him.

240
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,985
There are traces of an explosion, though.

241
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:29,906
We started a fire near
the Dragon's fuel bag, and it ignited.

242
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,908
I'm surprised you survived that.

243
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,371
One of our party members
quickly shielded us with defense magic,

244
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,039
<i>so we were unharmed.</i>

245
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,500
You're lucky to have such friends.

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,419
You're not getting it.

247
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,965
Even she didn't know
she could use that magic.

248
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,551
We could've all blown up, healer included.

249
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,679
Ultimately, the magic worked,

250
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,473
but if it had failed,
it would have made her a fool.

251
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,309
They're all like that.

252
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:06,067
How did you manage to defeat
the Red Dragon on your own, anyway?

253
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:12,031
Senshi and I distracted it,
and Laios, the tall-man in our party,

254
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,410
jumped into the Red Dragon's chest
and struck its weak point.

255
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,453
That's impressive.

256
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:21,082
A warrior should have courage.

257
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,418
<i>It wasn't courage.</i>

258
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:27,714
It turned out okay,
but it was a stupid gamble.

259
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,633
<i>Honestly, it sent shivers down my spine.</i>

260
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,928
<i>Someone who'd make that kind of call,
there's no telling where they'll end up!</i>

261
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,557
<i>There were a few members
who left our party,</i>

262
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,396
but looking back,
maybe they were the smarter ones.

263
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,734
I should have been less stubborn
and followed suit as well.

264
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:53,114
Are you saying it would have been better
to lose your friends?

265
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:55,950
I don't know.

266
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,330
Maybe my decision to join Laios

267
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,999
made it harder for him to back out.

268
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,378
Anyway, what happened after that?

269
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,840
We healed our wounds
and patched ourselves up.

270
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,092
And in this room…

271
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,808
We cooked up the Dragon's meat and ate it.

272
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:21,893
As you should.

273
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,270
It's your rightful reward
for bringing it down.

274
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,610
Was it after that
when the magician showed up?

275
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,404
How did you manage
to survive the encounter?

276
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:38,368
The mage in our party
held up against his attacks.

277
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,620
That long-ears?

278
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,081
She seemed so clueless, though.

279
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,874
Trust me, she is.

280
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,126
She used some shady magic back there.

281
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,589
Even if she makes it out of the dungeon,
I doubt she could lead a decent life.

282
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,260
They're stupid idiots.
Every last one of them.

283
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,096
They're a bunch of fools.

284
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,599
They believe that if they
try hard enough, they'll be rewarded.

285
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,811
How am I supposed to reason
with folks like that?

286
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,522
So, you're going to trick them?

287
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,983
There must be a better way.

288
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,862
If a couple of lies get me back
on the surface, I'm all for it!

289
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,280
I'm a coward, after all!

290
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,242
My life comes first, over everything!

291
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,494
Don't be like that.

292
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,666
Just admit you don't want to see them die.

293
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,265
What's this sucker doing here?

294
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,476
Did it crawl all the way up here?

295
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,360
Turns out, you were the smartest among us.

296
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,782
<i>Bloodstains…</i>

297
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,702
Like someone dragged a body along…

298
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,454
Hey.

299
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,788
Do you want to be left behind?

300
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,915
C-Coming.

301
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,424
I grabbed our stuff.

302
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,054
What do you think you're doing?!

303
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,680
You need to stay put!

304
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:23,973
I'm not feeling any pain.

305
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,851
That's because the medicine
is messing with your sense of pain!

306
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,687
Falin should still be nearby!

307
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,857
Calm down.

308
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,823
I've got something to say to you both.

309
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,744
Chilchuck, I've been thinking, and…

310
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,455
Let me go first.

311
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,583
Laios,

312
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,505
I can't even begin to imagine
how you must be feeling.

313
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,759
But we can't continue
the search like this.

314
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,263
It's going to end up
with one of us kicking the bucket.

315
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,433
Please, Laios.

316
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,021
Please be strong for now
and head back above ground!

317
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,649
I don't want to lose you guys!

318
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,944
My feelings might not match
the affection you have for your sister,

319
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,529
but I've got the three of you to lose!

320
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,031
Informing the Lord of the Island
about the lunatic magician

321
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,241
may prompt some action.

322
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,910
Maybe we could gather funds
to enlist help!

323
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,997
With enough preparation,
we can reach this level quicker next time!

324
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,793
So, please…

325
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,172
Let's head back, Laios.

326
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,178
To tell you the truth,

327
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:48,683
we're running short
on seasoning and other ingredients.

328
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:53,062
I want to make sure we can whip up
something delicious for Falin.

329
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,940
We should head back to the city
and replenish our supplies.

330
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,028
I've sent word
that the Red Dragon's been slain.

331
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,948
My brother should return
with the others soon.

332
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,452
When you're ready and return down here,

333
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,248
we'll do what we can to help you out.

334
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,544
All right.

335
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,258
Forgive me for making you worry.

336
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,720
Let's head back.

337
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,639
Yeah.
