1
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,837
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,635
How boring is this?

3
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:33,928
You got that right.

4
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,513
Take this, will you?

5
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,395
It's good!

6
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:44,897
It's good.

7
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,607
When we enter the dungeon again,

8
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,902
we won't be able
to have delicious food for a while.

9
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,737
Better savor it well, then.

10
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,740
Hey, Kabru!

11
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,493
How're you doing lately?

12
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,662
Seems like you're doing well.

13
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,581
Nah, we still have a long way to go.

14
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,084
Until just a while ago,
you were just fledglings.

15
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,002
But now you have an air of confidence.

16
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,839
On the other hand,
none of the other big parties...

17
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,675
are faring so well.

18
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,426
Is that so?

19
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,429
Missing persons. Falling outs.

20
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,182
Oh, and trouble over money matters.

21
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,268
To everyone's surprise,
it might be folks like you

22
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:25,354
who end up defeating the lunatic magician.

23
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,189
Oh, no.

24
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,691
I'm not sure about that.

25
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,693
So you say, but you just might!

26
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,949
- You gave him a polite smile.
- Huh?

27
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,410
Instead of putting on a polite smile
and being noncommittal,

28
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,370
you should have told him clearly.

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,456
"Of course, we'll be the ones
to defeat the magician."

30
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,836
"We won't become adventurers like you
who live from hand-to-mouth."

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,921
Rin...

32
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:57,136
Let's show them with action
rather than words.

33
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:02,641
So, we'll venture
a little deeper this time.

34
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,476
Let's make careful preparations.

35
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:15,988
Welcome.

36
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:20,200
A week's worth of food for six people
and water for two days.

37
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,453
Here you go.

38
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,419
Food is a trickier issue than monsters
when venturing into the lower levels.

39
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,838
Just a week's worth of food is this heavy.

40
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,383
I wonder how people manage
when they go underground for a month.

41
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,760
Mickbell,

42
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,763
let me tell you how.

43
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,728
They eat other adventurers
they meet in the dungeon!

44
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:55,027
{\an8}It's probably easier to hunt monsters
than attack humans.

45
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,905
I sure don't want to end up like them.

46
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,460
I've never been to this floor before,
but it's not that hard.

47
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,712
At this rate,
we could probably go even deeper.

48
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,924
You have a point, Rin,
but let's be careful.

49
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,802
You never know what might happen here.

50
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,180
I've heard that things have been strange
inside the dungeon recently.

51
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,183
Monsters are more active than usual,

52
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,811
and the dungeon's layout is shifting.

53
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:32,147
Something unusual is happening,
that's for sure.

54
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,066
Let's keep our guard up.

55
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,192
Hey!

56
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,195
Kabru, look what I found!

57
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,947
Open it.

58
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,074
It's just going to be
a waste of time again.

59
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,411
You never know. There might be
a stack of gold coins inside.

60
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,831
Like we ever discovered
anything valuable in those.

61
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,668
It's something a zombie was carrying
as if it were a treasure,

62
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,044
quite literally.

63
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,463
It wouldn't hurt to take a peek inside.

64
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:57,965
Huh?

65
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,466
What is it?

66
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:03,012
Whoa! Look at all that gold,
silver, and gems!

67
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,597
- Wow!
- Awesome!

68
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,974
Can I have some?

69
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,851
Money, so much.

70
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,648
I thought all the treasure in this place
had already been looted.

71
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,569
Maybe this is one of the strange things
happening inside the dungeon.

72
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,702
In any case, it's a big help.

73
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:29,371
Venturing into the lower levels
is quite expensive, after all.

74
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:35,085
All right. Let's call it a day for now
and return to town!

75
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,378
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

76
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,765
Looks like a party got wiped out here.

77
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:51,518
Oh dear. Seems like they were
on their way back to town.

78
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,062
The poor things.

79
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,980
I don't see any visible injuries.

80
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,191
Maybe they were attacked
by a type of ghost.

81
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,359
Maybe they starved.

82
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,321
No, I think they had a quarrel over money.

83
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,202
The corpse retriever
will probably find them soon,

84
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,954
but I'll pray for them
so they don't become zombies.

85
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,749
I can't do it the way Falin does, though.

86
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,173
What should we do
with their scattered stuff?

87
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,217
Let's gather them in one spot.

88
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,221
I bet they'll end up
in the corpse retriever's pockets, though.

89
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,767
Huh? What was that for?

90
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,102
I-It's nothing.

91
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,105
<i>My sword suddenly jumped.</i>

92
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,859
<i>What's going on? It was calm until now.</i>

93
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,362
<i>Hey, don't wrap around my fingers!</i>

94
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,741
<i>"Draw me!"</i>

95
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,036
<i>It feels like that's what it's saying!</i>

96
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,507
Marcille! Get away from the bodies!

97
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,758
Huh?

98
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,742
Stunning magic, huh?

99
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,829
Thank goodness it wasn't an explosion.

100
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,746
Ow!

101
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,039
Ugh, what the heck?!

102
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,792
They're all Treasure Bugs! Gross!

103
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,254
I see.

104
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,923
So they were all wiped out
by Treasure Bugs.

105
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,135
I haven't seen them around lately,
so I didn't realize.

106
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,387
What? You did realize, though.

107
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,890
Yeah! How did you know?

108
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,141
Um...

109
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,643
I thought... it moved.

110
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,061
<i>My sword, I mean.</i>

111
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,856
<i>It's already calm again.</i>

112
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,650
<i>It probably responded
to the Treasure Bug, right?</i>

113
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,445
If that's the case...

114
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,281
{\an8}He's becoming less and less human.

115
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,334
There.

116
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,586
{\an8}No!

117
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,964
He's really sorting them out.

118
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,176
These are edible.

119
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,469
And these aren't.

120
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,888
Do they taste good, though?

121
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,264
Of course.

122
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,976
Bugs are an excellent source of nutrition.

123
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,728
They have a delicious taste
and flavor, too.

124
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,731
And they look good as well.

125
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,608
Don't show its underside to us.

126
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,903
How can you tell
whether they're edible or not?

127
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,238
It depends.

128
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,615
This one is easy to tell.

129
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,369
The necklace has legs growing
between its segments.

130
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,122
With brooches and coins,
you look at their underside.

131
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:03,126
It's interesting how Coin Bugs
have different designs based on their sex.

132
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,672
Rings have a springy shank.

133
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,509
With tiaras, dunk them in water,
and you can tell them apart easily.

134
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,886
If they float, they're Treasure Bugs.

135
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,137
They're light, after all.

136
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,308
Anyway, let's cook them
while they're still senseless.

137
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,019
To improve their texture,

138
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,022
remove the legs from the pearl centipedes.

139
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,525
Then, skewer and grill them.

140
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:31,446
Heat some oil and cook the underside
of the Coin Bugs.

141
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,032
Salt them lightly,

142
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,077
and coat them with oil as you stir them.

143
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,537
There!

144
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,165
{\an8}It looks nice if you flip them
with their backs facing up.

145
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,669
For the tiara, remove the eggs and larvae,

146
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,172
shatter the nest, and stew together.

147
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,051
Put them in a jar...

148
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,345
And it's done!

149
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,056
NATURAL AND TASTY TREASURE BUG SNACKS

150
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,811
{\an8}It looks nice, but it doesn't really
whet my appetite in more ways than one.

151
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:06,773
That said, I have eaten a Coin Bug before.

152
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,443
There are local cuisines like this.

153
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,821
It looks lucky,
and it's supposed to bring good fortune.

154
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,784
{\an8}It's way better
than the one I had a long time ago!

155
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,578
Of course, it is.

156
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,333
Monsters inside the dungeon
generally taste better than those outside.

157
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:28,962
If you keep them outside,
their flavor quickly deteriorates.

158
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,807
It's gooey.

159
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,852
I can't wear necklaces anymore.

160
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,854
They're like small fish and pretty tasty.

161
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,691
The same monster will taste better
when they're from the lower levels.

162
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,901
I can't wait to try it.

163
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,361
Thank you.

164
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,367
<i>It's sweet and delicious.</i>

165
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,328
<i>They really look just like gems.</i>

166
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,248
<i>In the context of concealing itself
from enemies through camouflage,</i>

167
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,292
<i>it's one of your kind.</i>

168
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,211
<i>Is that why you responded?</i>

169
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,254
<i>Wait...</i>

170
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,174
Give me one.

171
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,232
Nothing.

172
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,569
<i>That was intimidation.</i>

173
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,907
<i>Did it try to defeat the bug with me
because it thinks I'm a friend?</i>

174
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,660
<i>You cute thing!</i>

175
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,245
<i>Let me give you a name.</i>

176
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,624
Let's get going soon.

177
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,502
Can I throw away the inedible ones?

178
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,795
If you want.

179
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,799
What happens if you eat the inedible ones?

180
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,301
Do they taste bad? Or are they poisonous?

181
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,554
What are you talking about?

182
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,808
You can't possibly eat real gems.

183
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,687
<i>You can't possibly eat real gems.</i>

184
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,063
<i>Real gems...</i>

185
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,649
<i>Gems...</i>

186
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,902
{\an8}- You should have said that first!
- You should have said that first!

187
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,033
I know! Your name is Kensuke!

188
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,506
You're still munching on that?

189
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,383
It's heartier than it looks.

190
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,719
Seriously, you're making it hard
to keep my guard up.

191
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,685
It suddenly got cold.

192
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,772
That white hazy thing...

193
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,734
That's a lot of ghosts.

194
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,736
Let's go.
It wouldn't do for us to be spotted.

195
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,113
Ghosts?

196
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,699
They must've gathered,
attracted by the corpses.

197
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,870
{\an8}Can't you simply use magic to...

198
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,416
{\an8}Right. Falin isn't with us.

199
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,335
{\an8}I miss her, too.

200
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,005
It was the least I could do,
but I prayed for them.

201
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,633
So I don't think
the ghosts will possess the bodies there...

202
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:26,932
There's one behind us.

203
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,391
Run!

204
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,368
Stupid!

205
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,878
My ears...

206
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,880
Hurry! Before another one comes!

207
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,636
Looks like that noise
attracted their attention even more.

208
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,016
Don't you know other magic
besides something so flashy?

209
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,144
Something random like the stuff
Falin used would have done.

210
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:18,191
{\an8}Random? Don't you know
how advanced her magic was?

211
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,779
Falin, Laios' sister,

212
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,032
was good at dealing with ghosts.

213
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,327
<i>Lifgant Ardinbam.</i>

214
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,873
There! That should do it.

215
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,376
Ghosts can't harm you anymore.

216
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,506
Isn't it easier to blow up ghosts
when they show up?

217
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,634
It should be easy with your magic, Falin.

218
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,514
I'd rather not do stuff like that.

219
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:54,978
A dispersed ghost will simply return
to its normal state over time.

220
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,147
It causes them unnecessary suffering.

221
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:58,857
How sweet of you.

222
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,401
I admire your principles, but...

223
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,072
Those who steal another person's body...

224
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,868
deserve some punishment, don't you think?

225
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,419
He's one of the missing adventurers.

226
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,964
All right. Give me a moment.

227
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,008
I'll neutralize him and...

228
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,220
Let me handle it.
There's no need to harm it.

229
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,807
Wait, Falin! Don't do anything reckless!

230
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,822
I'm sorry. Please return him.

231
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,537
Falin!

232
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,088
Seems like she was an important person.

233
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,716
Yeah. Falin was really amazing.

234
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,845
If the ghosts catch up with us,

235
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,349
I'll have to do something with my magic.

236
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,308
Forget it!

237
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,520
Are you planning to explode
all those ghosts individually?

238
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,734
So, I should do what Falin did, right?

239
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,781
Make them explode with a gentle embrace.

240
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,117
- Make them explode with...
- No way! You couldn't possibly!

241
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,829
You said yourself you can't do it
the way Falin does it!

242
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,747
Falin wouldn't say that, though!

243
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,500
Anyway, what if you run out of magic?

244
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,003
That's why I'm trying to make them explode
with the minimal amount of magic needed!

245
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,172
And I'm saying you can't do that!

246
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,507
Hey, both of you...

247
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,970
Turns out it's not that easy
to run from the dead.

248
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,264
Right.

249
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,016
They'll catch us if we bicker
in a place like this.

250
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,270
Wait, what are you doing?

251
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,648
I'll prepare a charm
to drive away the ghosts.

252
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,525
A charm?

253
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,609
Holy water.

254
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,445
You had that on you?

255
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,655
No. I'm going to make it now.

256
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,699
{\an8}Make it?

257
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,659
{\an8}Are you a priest or something?

258
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:20,415
<i>There are many customs around the world
to ward off different demons.</i>

259
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,958
<i>For example, lighting a fire.</i>

260
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:26,463
<i>Fire drives away the darkness
and has the power to create and take.</i>

261
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:27,922
<i>Everywhere and throughout the ages,</i>

262
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,509
<i>fire has been used
to ward off demons and as something holy.</i>

263
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,928
That's true,

264
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,139
but will the light of a candle
ward off ghosts?

265
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,975
While each may be weak on their own,

266
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:42,020
together in large numbers,
they can become a substantial force.

267
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,440
<i>Another example is the golden beetle.</i>

268
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,443
<i>Its characteristics led to it
being worshipped</i>

269
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,862
as a symbol of the sun and its deity.

270
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,656
<i>Another example is alcohol.</i>

271
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:58,703
It's an essential offering to a god
and possesses disinfective properties.

272
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,830
<i>Another example is salt.</i>

273
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,460
There are customs that use it
to drive away evil and cleanse oneself.

274
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,380
Sugar is similar to that,
so I'll add some just in case.

275
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,966
It's probably less effective,
so I'll add a lot.

276
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,843
You're totally winging this!

277
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,970
Aside from that, there are herbs

278
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,264
and the internal organs of creatures.

279
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,309
Add the power of fire to this and...

280
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,314
We have holy water!

281
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,857
SPECIAL FUSION HOLY WATER

282
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,027
Here they come!

283
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,197
Tightly seal the jar of holy water and...

284
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,115
Seal?!

285
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,658
Aren't you going to use it?

286
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,659
Be patient.

287
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,244
Then, tie it with string...

288
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,873
At this rate...

289
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,800
<i>Oh no...</i>

290
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,636
<i>Falin.</i>

291
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,935
<i>That day, if only she didn't shield me...</i>

292
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,647
<i>If I were the one devoured
by the dragon instead,</i>

293
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,192
<i>this sorry mess would never have happened.</i>

294
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,736
<i>Forgive me.</i>

295
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,251
Huh?

296
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,013
For a moment just now,
I saw my dead dad beyond the river.

297
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,433
W-What on earth?

298
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,395
<i>The ghosts that come in contact
with the jar of holy water are dispersing.</i>

299
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,819
That holy water is doing the trick, huh?

300
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,321
That actually works?

301
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,701
Maybe we were being possessed...

302
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,203
by Falin.

303
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,079
How could you say that?

304
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,956
Falin would never do such a thing.

305
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,000
She isn't a ghost yet in the first place!

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,710
No, that's not what I meant.

307
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,380
We shouldn't say stuff like,
"Only Falin could have done this,"

308
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,342
or "Things would've been easier
if Falin was around."

309
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,094
Right now, it's just us.

310
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,098
So we have to take care
of things on our own.

311
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,978
You're right.

312
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:30,897
Senshi!

313
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,233
Let me help.

314
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,709
It's over.

315
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,130
I-It's completely covered in frost!

316
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:01,094
Using it like this is more effective
than scattering it, don't you think?

317
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,095
True.

318
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,388
Ghosts can pass through walls,

319
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,473
so it won't matter
if the jar is sealed or not.

320
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,476
But what is this?

321
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,775
You made ice cream.

322
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,905
EXORCISM SORBET TO DRIVE AWAY EVILS

323
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,617
Is it safe to eat something
that came in contact with so many ghosts?

324
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:29,289
And consuming such potent holy water
could cause problems as well.

325
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,167
I think I'm taking too much sugar today.

326
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:38,506
It's good!

327
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,473
You're right. It's good!

328
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,101
It tastes really fresh!

329
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:54,439
{\an8}Seems like we managed to drive away
the ghosts without making them too upset.

330
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:55,398
{\an8}True!

331
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,191
You added the internal organs
of a creature.

332
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,027
What creature?

333
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,279
I added some Slime shavings.

334
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,614
So that's why it jiggles a little.

335
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,908
I love how smooth the texture is.

336
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,956
This... makes me think...

337
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,670
If Falin were here, we probably
couldn't have had such tasty food.

338
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:20,673
{\an8}Huh?

339
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,508
Are you saying...

340
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,720
you're glad Falin ended up that way?

341
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,264
Is that what you're saying? Now?!

342
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,017
Huh? No, I was just...

343
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,145
There are things you should say
and things you shouldn't.

344
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,195
<i>If only Falin were here right about now.</i>

345
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:46,657
{\an8}He meant to say
every cloud has a silver lining.

346
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,452
{\an8}<i>She'd say something like that
to clarify what I meant!</i>

347
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:54,999
{\an8}Your bond with your friends
is what really grew cold, huh?

348
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,045
{\an8}<i>Please return soon, Falin!</i>
