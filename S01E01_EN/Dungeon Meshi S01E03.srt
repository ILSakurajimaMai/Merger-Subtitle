1
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:26,837
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:33,928
I'm so tired.

3
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,179
All these stairs...

4
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,181
doesn't it feel like
you're twice as tired?

5
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,184
A moderate amount of fatigue
makes your meal taste better.

6
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,977
In moderation, sure.

7
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,439
Give me your sword.

8
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,816
Sure.

9
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,946
There should be a trick door around here.

10
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,794
I almost forgot that the door led here.

11
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,754
It saved us quite a bit of time.

12
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,633
Huh?

13
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,343
What is it?

14
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,680
The decoration on my sword guard is gone.

15
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,099
It's because you were reckless with it.

16
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,059
Was it my fault?

17
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,646
No, it was coming loose for a while now.

18
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:30,651
<i>I was trying to hold it together
with string or glue,</i>

19
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,735
<i>but I guess it was time.</i>

20
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,822
{\an8}Is there a problem if it's gone?

21
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,448
{\an8}Nope. Not at all.

22
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,577
{\an8}Was it a memento or something?

23
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,538
{\an8}A memento... I suppose you could say that.

24
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,709
<i>Three years ago,
when I was just a beginner,</i>

25
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,170
<i>I joined a gold-peeling crew
to get some experience.</i>

26
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,089
<i>Gold-peeling?</i>

27
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,467
<i>A long time ago, this castle
was completely covered in gold,</i>

28
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,344
<i>and peeling it made quite a profit.</i>

29
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,266
This place has been
mostly peeled already.

30
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,977
Let's see if there's anything
inside the castle.

31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,145
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:10,524
Laios, isn't it dangerous for us to enter
the castle with our current abilities?

33
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:14,320
Yeah, but the two of us
can't turn back on our own.

34
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,328
What the hell?

35
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,787
How awful.

36
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,748
It's completely rotten away.

37
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,000
I guess that's what happens
if you die in here.

38
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,877
No one finds you.

39
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,755
Hey! Come over here!

40
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,056
You could probably sell these.

41
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,682
They're better than what we saw earlier,

42
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,143
but you can only melt them down
and sell them for ingredients...

43
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,522
T-The armor moved!

44
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,274
It's a monster! Run!

45
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,778
We're no match for it. Run!

46
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,994
You...!

47
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,875
D-Dammit!

48
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,126
My sword...

49
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:22,471
Come on...!

50
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,564
I did it!

51
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,984
{\an8}- Laios!
- Huh?

52
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,490
<i>Something like that happened.</i>

53
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,076
And this is the sword I got then.

54
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,369
So you lost...

55
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,957
It was my first death, so for a while,
simply seeing an armor terrified me.

56
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,671
I read a lot of documents,
but none of them described how they taste.

57
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,340
I wonder what they taste like.

58
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,385
Senshi, how would you cook them?

59
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,513
Armor isn't edible.

60
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:09,018
Living Armor is simply controlled
by magic, and it's not some creature.

61
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,978
I-I know that, but...

62
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,980
What about the leather clasps?

63
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,441
{\an8}It's difficult to eat tanned hide,

64
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,278
{\an8}and it's far easier
to catch other monsters.

65
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:23,032
If you're that hungry for armor,
cook and eat your own.

66
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,118
I see.

67
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,662
I guess we can't eat Living Armor.

68
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,290
Come on, let's go.

69
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,004
{\an8}I'd rather not fight them now.

70
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,006
{\an8}How about running our way past them?

71
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,010
{\an8}They're slow,
so we could easily shake them off.

72
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,219
{\an8}True.

73
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,264
{\an8}Are you all okay with that?

74
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,390
{\an8}Sure.

75
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,893
We don't know
which set of armor might move.

76
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,394
Everyone, be careful.

77
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,395
Ready?

78
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,452
H-Here comes!

79
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,086
Run!

80
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,200
Our way is completely blocked!

81
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,701
What the heck?

82
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,579
{\an8}H-Hey! This is bad!

83
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,957
{\an8}Let's turn back for now and regroup!

84
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,084
{\an8}Pull back!

85
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,762
They're especially persistent today.

86
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,140
I wonder if something
put them in a bad mood.

87
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,099
No way!

88
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,436
{\an8}They don't have
physical conditions or feelings.

89
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,857
{\an8}That's why it should be easy if we can
defeat whoever is controlling them.

90
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,234
Are you sure there's someone?

91
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,485
I've never seen them.

92
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,238
USUALLY

93
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,700
<i>Usually, they only attack anyone
who gets close to them.</i>

94
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,495
<i>But today, they clearly blocked our path.</i>

95
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:39,293
<i>In other words, maybe they're
guarding something that's farther ahead.</i>

96
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,963
Whoever is controlling them is close by?

97
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,133
You're right. That might be possible.

98
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,927
{\an8}What? Is it a monster?

99
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,179
{\an8}I don't know.

100
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,807
{\an8}But a magic-user with such power
can't be anyone decent!

101
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,729
{\an8}Anyway, we have to find a way
to get past that barrier of armor and...

102
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,816
{\an8}So, if we can reach the magic-user
who is controlling the Living Armor,

103
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,736
we might be able to stop them.

104
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,279
But how?

105
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,405
For example...

106
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,116
Three of us act as bait
to draw their attention

107
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,494
while one of us goes past the door.

108
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,582
Good luck.

109
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,793
I thought you might be
the most fitting for the role

110
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,921
since you're good at going unnoticed.

111
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,923
I'm no good in combat.

112
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,259
Besides, Living Armor
doesn't have eyes or ears,

113
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,262
so going unnoticed doesn't help much
against something that's not alive.

114
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,015
Doesn't have eyes or ears...

115
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,064
Are you ready?

116
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,317
All right! Let's go!

117
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:46,818
Come on!

118
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,197
Gather around us, you sets of armor!

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,407
They're all coming!

120
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,700
Don't panic!

121
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:04,836
<i>Aslam!</i>

122
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,865
What? There's another Living Armor here?

123
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,290
<i>I've never seen this type of armor move.</i>

124
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,918
<i>I don't see anyone
who's controlling it, though.</i>

125
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,921
<i>It looks stronger
than the armor back there.</i>

126
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,135
<i>I can't call for backup, though.</i>

127
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,472
<i>Anyway, I have to figure out on my own
what they're guarding.</i>

128
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,480
<i>I'll cut off its arm or leg</i>

129
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,482
<i>and render it immobile!</i>

130
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,715
Dammit! You...!

131
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,268
<i>Why did it guard its shield?</i>

132
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,479
<i>What's that?</i>

133
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,733
<i>There's something on its shield.</i>

134
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,737
{\an8}<i>Somehow, it seems very familiar.</i>

135
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:01,745
<i>Right.</i>

136
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,875
<i>It's...</i>

137
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,132
<i>An egg case!</i>

138
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,843
<i>It's an egg of some creature.</i>

139
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:17,886
<i>That's what it shielded!</i>

140
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,058
<i>But what egg could it be?</i>

141
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,727
<i>Is it the egg of whoever
is controlling the armor?</i>

142
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,106
<i>Besides, Living Armor
doesn't have eyes or ears.</i>

143
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,315
<i>That's not it!</i>

144
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,900
<i>It's been bugging me all this time.</i>

145
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,486
<i>They're inorganic, without eyes or ears.</i>

146
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,739
<i>The way they pick up their head
and put it back on.</i>

147
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,326
<i>The way they turn their head
and follow our movements.</i>

148
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,829
<i>And the egg...</i>

149
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,707
<i>There's no doubt about it!
They're living creatures!</i>

150
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,669
<i>No one is giving them orders.</i>

151
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:55,549
<i>They're simply acting on their instincts
and trying to protect the egg.</i>

152
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,636
<i>In that case,
there are many ways to defeat them!</i>

153
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:01,930
<i>And...</i>

154
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,558
<i>they're edible!</i>

155
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,024
This is endless!

156
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,277
Are you serious?!

157
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,073
Don't pause! It's dangerous if you freeze!

158
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,408
Senshi! Behind you!

159
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,285
<i>Aslam!</i>

160
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,746
Huh? Hey!

161
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,253
Do they share parts?

162
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,171
What?!

163
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,797
Is that even possible?!

164
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,925
Hey, Laios!

165
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,761
Do something about these armors quickly!

166
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,266
<i>These Living Armors don't die
even when you cut off their heads.</i>

167
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,935
<i>But if they're creatures,
they must be killable.</i>

168
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,441
<i>Either by internal injury, outflow
of body fluid, suffocation, or starvation.</i>

169
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,360
<i>It's not realistic to try a method
that takes time.</i>

170
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:01,281
<i>First, I need to determine
the form of the creature that is inside.</i>

171
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:07,829
<i>For an amorphous creature like a Slime,
its movements are too rigid.</i>

172
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,209
<i>Is it possible that they're swarms
of tiny creatures?</i>

173
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,628
<i>But they don't make any sound,
so that seems unlikely.</i>

174
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,965
<i>Or maybe creatures with long limbs
are controlling them from inside.</i>

175
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,885
<i>They could be other creatures,</i>

176
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,388
<i>but it's probably easier
to see for myself.</i>

177
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,016
<i>It doesn't seem like
I can match it in strength.</i>

178
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,726
<i>In that case,</i>

179
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,728
<i>I only have one option!</i>

180
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,773
<i>Go for the shield with the egg attached,
and make it drop its guard!</i>

181
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,244
Got it!

182
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,872
What's inside? Huh?

183
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,124
There's nothing!

184
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,711
It's empty.

185
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,131
Could it have been a camouflage tactic
when it retrieved its head?

186
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,634
<i>This is bad.</i>

187
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,886
{\an8}I need... I need to think of my next move!

188
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,516
What?

189
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,395
<i>Couldn't it see which pillar I hid behind?</i>

190
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,231
<i>There must be something in its head, then.</i>

191
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,608
A gap?

192
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,580
I see. It was a mollusk!

193
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,790
It was clinging to the inside.

194
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,126
<i>Could it have survived amputation</i>

195
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,670
<i>because it was a colony
of many creatures to begin with?</i>

196
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,423
<i>Is it looking for its head?</i>

197
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,967
<i>Maybe in its current state...</i>

198
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,320
Hmm, how interesting!

199
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,946
Just how many are there?

200
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,783
They mimic muscle movements

201
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,661
by expanding
and contracting at the joints.

202
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,747
I wonder if they're hermaphrodites.

203
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,791
I wonder which creature laid the egg.

204
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,837
I forgot I don't have time
for this right now!

205
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,340
Excuse me!

206
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,217
You...! Just let go!

207
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,345
Everyone! Come over here now!

208
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,721
- Now's not the time!
- Now's not the time!

209
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,685
Huh?

210
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,693
What was that? How did you do that?!

211
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,572
So there was a magic-user?!

212
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,741
There were no magic-users.

213
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,827
The Living Armors weren't controlled.

214
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,287
They were creatures.

215
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,705
Huh?

216
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,041
Look at the inside of this armor.

217
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,543
There are two layers,
and something is clinging between them.

218
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,713
This is the identity of the Living Armor.

219
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,970
<i>By clasping hands inside the armor,</i>

220
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,806
<i>they were acting
as muscles of different parts.</i>

221
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,850
Even though each creature is weak,

222
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,728
by dividing the body parts
and utilizing the armor's structure,

223
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,481
they can imitate human movements.

224
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,109
Unluckily for us,

225
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,861
it seems we encountered them
during the spawning season this time.

226
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,115
Spawning?! These things hatch from eggs?!

227
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,368
That's right! They hatch from eggs!

228
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,578
{\an8}No one realized this until now!

229
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,915
{\an8}Everyone thought they were simply
Living Armor controlled by magic!

230
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,293
{\an8}If I were to reveal this fact,
it would cause a huge stir in our circle!

231
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,880
You know how he talks fast

232
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,132
when it comes to monsters?

233
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,508
It creeps me out.

234
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,385
Hush! Stop that.

235
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,636
Senshi!

236
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,889
We might not be able to eat armor,
but what about the stuff inside?

237
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,308
Looks pretty nutritious, doesn't it?

238
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,149
There's no way we can eat something
so mysterious!

239
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,276
Now, now, Marcille.

240
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,821
Every food is a mystery
until that first bite.

241
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,700
{\an8}Now's not the time to be trying it!

242
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:14,951
Let's give it a shot.

243
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,329
I'm using this ingredient
for the first time,

244
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,831
so I'm not confident, though.

245
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,458
Thanks, Senshi.

246
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,917
No way!

247
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,503
What if it's extremely poisonous?

248
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:30,842
I doubt a creature with potent poison
would hide itself inside a shell.

249
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,304
But how should I cook it?

250
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,222
This underside...

251
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,017
didn't budge when I tried
to pry it open with my hands.

252
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,354
But when I cut this part with a blade,
it couldn't close the gap.

253
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,691
Maybe it was an adductor muscle
that it uses to close the gap,

254
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,526
like a scallop.

255
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,862
I see. So it's a shellfish.

256
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,864
All right, I've decided.

257
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,533
Pry the meat from the armor, will you?

258
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,543
It drowned.

259
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,379
I guess you can't purge
the sand with water.

260
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,883
I don't know if they even need
to be purged of sand.

261
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,719
I'm a bit worried
about their internal organs,

262
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,387
so I'll remove them.

263
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,016
The sliced meat will go inside a soup.

264
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,563
Oil, meat from the Living Armor,
herbs, and seasoning.

265
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,318
And the head...

266
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,404
will be steamed.

267
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,158
And finally,
we might as well make the classic dish.

268
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,250
It's ready!

269
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,168
SAUTÉED LIVING ARMOR AND SOUP

270
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,171
GRILLED LIVING ARMOR

271
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:53,174
{\an8}STEAM-BAKED LIVING ARMOR

272
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,593
Marcille, which do you want to have first?

273
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,594
What?

274
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,596
I-I'll have the soup, then...

275
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,600
Wait, do antidotes
work against food poisoning as well?

276
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,686
It doesn't smell bad.

277
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,230
It smells faintly of iron.

278
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:08,940
Laios,

279
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:09,858
here.

280
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,818
It's hot!

281
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,283
Why are you all looking at me like that?

282
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,287
{\an8}You've been craving Living Armor
for a long time now, right?

283
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,956
{\an8}We shouldn't eat it before you do.

284
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,583
I see...

285
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,585
If he dies, let's leave him here.

286
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,711
Yeah.

287
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,259
- <i>Did he die?</i>
- <i>Did he die?</i>

288
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,802
It's delicious!

289
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,347
What on earth? It's so delicious!

290
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:45,393
At first, it tasted bland,
but the flavor kicks in later!

291
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,271
How long does it take before you
start having symptoms of food poisoning?

292
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,647
It depends on the food.

293
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,737
So that's what it tastes like.

294
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,990
Not bad, but I think
I could've cooked it better.

295
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,366
How about the dish you have?

296
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,664
Well, I suppose this one should be safe
because it was stir-fried with herbs.

297
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,378
H-How is it?

298
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,547
It's not bad.

299
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,811
What do you think, Marcille?

300
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,232
It tastes a bit like mushrooms.

301
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,274
Right?

302
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,653
The steam-baked one
looks ready and tasty, too.

303
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,405
It has to taste great!

304
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,035
It tastes like mold.

305
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,746
The odor of the helmet
must've gotten trapped in it.

306
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,417
Here.

307
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,463
You know, I've been in the dungeon
for a long time now,

308
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,091
but I never thought they were edible.

309
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:02,220
{\an8}Nobody would expect Living Armor
to be a sort of shellfish

310
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,430
{\an8}that hatch from eggs.

311
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,101
Maybe when they're newborns
and juveniles, they're very small,

312
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,687
and no one suspects them
to be Living Armor.

313
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,690
<i>They probably form shells as they grow.</i>

314
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,191
<i>Then, they start forming colonies.</i>

315
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,820
<i>And when they can move,
they travel looking for other colonies.</i>

316
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,824
<i>Maybe the armor standing in rows
were looking for partners.</i>

317
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:27,662
<i>They are likely hermaphrodites
and the biggest colony lays an egg.</i>

318
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,832
<i>Oh! That means...</i>

319
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,625
The armor I occasionally see holding hands

320
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,502
might not have been
adventurers fooling around.

321
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,421
Maybe they were actually mating!

322
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,839
You can drop it now.

323
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,467
<i>To think the thing
I was so scared of for a time</i>

324
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,221
<i>was such a tasty and feeble monster.</i>

325
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,599
Your sword broke, huh?

326
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,977
Why don't you take that one?

327
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,065
Laios!

328
00:21:56,774 --> 00:22:00,153
{\an8}If you're going to use that sword,
shall I test it to see if it's not cursed?

329
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,821
No need!

330
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,406
I'm absolutely sure it's not cursed!

331
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,699
I can tell!

332
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,284
You seem awfully confident.

333
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,412
Don't come to me if you end up
with some weird curse.

334
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,708
Everyone, wait for me!

335
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,253
<i>Armed with a new sword,</i>

336
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,630
<i>their journey continues.</i>

337
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:24,844
<i>The other three had no way of knowing</i>

338
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,805
<i>that they had a new companion.</i>
