00:01:22,685 --> 00:01:26,897
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,618
It's locked again.

3
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:40,953
Give me a minute.

4
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,329
I'll open it in no time.

5
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,209
{\an8}We walked quite a bit already,

6
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:50,212
{\an8}so maybe we can call it a day soon.

7
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:56,510
You sure are clever, Marcille,
answering with your stomach.

8
00:01:57,344 --> 00:01:58,971
It wasn't me!

9
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:00,723
It's completely normal.

10
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:03,851
After all, we've only had snacks today.

11
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:07,396
But Laios, I'm against taking a break.

12
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:12,818
The only foodstuff we found today
was a bowl full of Treasure Bugs.

13
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:16,655
{\an8}Even if we have to push ourselves,
we should make for the fourth floor.

14
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:22,369
Still, the monsters will get tougher
and tougher the further we go.

15
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,830
I think we should conserve our energy.

16
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:27,708
But even if we save our energy,

17
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,627
it won't matter
if we pass out from hunger.

18
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,631
But without energy,
we wouldn't be able to defeat monsters...

19
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:36,717
It's open.

20
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:48,854
This room looks like
it used to be a dining hall.

21
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:51,857
This must've been a luxurious dining table
once upon a time.

22
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:01,116
But now, it's just the dead
haunting this place.

23
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,077
There's not even a single rat in here.

24
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,745
I'm not eating a rat, okay?

25
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,750
I wonder why it's always
dead humans who attack us.

26
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:12,836
Can't a whole roasted pig
come after us for a change?

27
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,254
Don't be silly.

28
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:16,799
{\an8}"Come after us"...

29
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:20,010
But we do have...

30
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:24,056
food coming after us!

31
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,894
Living Painting?

32
00:03:28,978 --> 00:03:30,020
Watch it, Laios!

33
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:34,149
You got too close!

34
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,401
You could've gotten sucked in!

35
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:38,362
{\an8}That's what I wanted!
I was just getting to the good part!

36
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:39,280
{\an8}What?

37
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:42,283
There were grapes in that painting.

38
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:43,951
In other words,

39
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:46,954
you were trying
to eat the food in the painting.

40
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:49,581
That's right.
Pretty neat idea, don't you think?

41
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:51,292
- Absolutely not!
- You moron!

42
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,712
- Moron! What were you thinking?
- Ever heard the saying, "pie in the sky"?

43
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:58,465
I-I know you can't
actually eat a pie in the sky.

44
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:02,136
But a painting of someone
eating a pie in the sky works!

45
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:05,472
You'll end up getting killed
inside the painting.

46
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,099
{\an8}Precisely!

47
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:10,728
{\an8}Inside the painting, we should be able
to interact with each other!

48
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:17,401
Fine. Have it your way, then.

49
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:19,111
But you can only give it a try once.

50
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,197
We'll tie a rope around you.

51
00:04:23,324 --> 00:04:25,701
If you give us a signal,
we'll pull you out.

52
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,662
Which painting should I go for?

53
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:31,623
This one looks pretty good.

54
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:33,792
There's a lot of delicious food in it.

55
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:36,503
All right, I'll go for this painting.

56
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:48,265
Ow.

57
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:49,350
Hey, you.

58
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,852
<i>I've already been spotted!</i>

59
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:53,645
That sword...

60
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:56,357
You're wearing odd armor,

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,484
but you're one of the castle guards,
aren't you?

62
00:04:58,567 --> 00:04:59,401
Huh?

63
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:02,237
Here, carry this.

64
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:06,158
Seriously, we're always
running short on hands.

65
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:08,827
This way! Don't space out!

66
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:16,668
Look at his face. He looks so clever!

67
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:20,672
Yes, the shape of his nose
is just like yours.

68
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:24,676
He will lead the kingdom
splendidly one day.

69
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:29,181
- There, there. You're a good boy.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,350
Stop daydreaming!

71
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,185
Bring the next plate already!

72
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,688
- Um, could I have a bite--
- I have it!

73
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:40,275
{\an8}Delgal! Your name is Delgal!

74
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:45,322
Delgal, you'll become a great king!

75
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:46,406
This is no good!

76
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,534
There's no chance of me eating anything!

77
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:52,246
Help me out!

78
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:54,498
It's his signal!

79
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:55,833
Pull!

80
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:00,796
How was it?

81
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:06,009
I was so close to getting a bite.

82
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:09,263
{\an8}But the vibe just wasn't right.

83
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:11,682
{\an8}- The vibe?
- That's what stopped you?

84
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:14,893
{\an8}Yeah, it was totally the vibe.

85
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:16,478
One more time!

86
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:19,106
I can grab a bite
if the situation is more suitable.

87
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,400
What do you mean by "suitable"?

88
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:22,651
Let's see.

89
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:26,613
I guess it needs to be more casual.

90
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,951
Casual?

91
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:34,163
How about this one?

92
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:36,790
They have fancy food,
it looks like a party,

93
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:38,458
and there's even someone dancing naked.

94
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:39,918
This is it! Here I go!

95
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:51,013
You drunk fool!

96
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:53,932
What do you think you're doing
in front of the king?

97
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,768
Get down from the table now!

98
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:57,895
Oh, stop it.

99
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,898
{\an8}Today is my wedding day.

100
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:04,651
Pardon this man for getting
a little too carried away.

101
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:06,862
But Prince Delgal...

102
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:08,572
<i>Delgal?</i>

103
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,908
<i>Is he the baby in the painting earlier?</i>

104
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,326
Come on, go!

105
00:07:14,995 --> 00:07:15,913
<i>That was a close call!</i>

106
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:17,664
Delgal!

107
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:19,416
Father!

108
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,253
I am glad to see
how splendidly you have grown.

109
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:26,548
To the future of this kingdom.

110
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:43,398
F-Father!

111
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:46,610
He was poisoned!

112
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,948
<i>Guess I'll take some back with me
and enjoy them quietly later.</i>

113
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:57,329
Sorry.

114
00:07:57,412 --> 00:07:58,580
Your Majesty!

115
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:00,499
Treat him now!

116
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:01,458
Hurry!

117
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:04,628
<i>That elf, I spotted him
in the previous painting as well.</i>

118
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,463
<i>I wonder if he's a jester or something.</i>

119
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:12,719
Look what I've got!

120
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:14,471
I brought back food this time...

121
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:17,099
Wait, what? It's all gone!

122
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:21,728
{\an8}So I can't take food out of the painting.

123
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:24,481
{\an8}The only way is to eat them
inside the painting!

124
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:28,318
Again! Now that it's come to this,
I must have a taste of the food!

125
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:37,619
FULL-COURSE OF COURT CUISINE

126
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:43,458
<i>Is this a crowning ceremony?</i>

127
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,461
<i>So that prince succeeded to the throne.</i>

128
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:54,261
May this kingdom and its people
flourish for eternity.

129
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:04,396
<i>It's good!</i>

130
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:10,360
<i>It's good!</i>

131
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:12,821
<i>I thought it might taste like paint,</i>

132
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:15,282
<i>but this is a real feast!</i>

133
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:28,754
Seconds, please.

134
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,760
<i>I sure ate a ton.</i>

135
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:36,803
I'm stuffed.

136
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:40,724
Guess I'll go back now.

137
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:47,022
<i>Huh? This is...</i>

138
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:51,652
- You don't belong to this castle.
- <i>Damn!</i>

139
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,737
What are you doing?

140
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,365
You were there when the prince was born
and also at his wedding.

141
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,660
What is your purpose?

142
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:01,286
Are you after the throne?

143
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:06,166
I'll reduce you to ashes right now!

144
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:10,754
The painting!

145
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,968
Did something happen inside the painting?

146
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:20,764
There were tons of mouthwatering dishes.

147
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:23,475
As I was about to leave
after eating my fill,

148
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,437
someone realized I was an outsider,
grabbed me by the collar,

149
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,232
{\an8}and got really mad.

150
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:31,900
{\an8}I'm not surprised.

151
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,486
{\an8}I was so scared.

152
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,825
Now that I'm relaxed,
I'm starting to feel hungry again.

153
00:10:41,284 --> 00:10:45,038
{\an8}Wait, what? Even though I ate a lot,
my stomach still feels empty!

154
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:47,249
What did we tell you?

155
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:49,584
It was just a pie in the sky!

156
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,294
You wasted our time!

157
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:54,131
But it really tasted good!

158
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,097
Was this the kitchen?

159
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:05,559
We can collect water
from the room next door,

160
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,769
and it's a nice spot to rest for a bit.

161
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,772
If you hadn't fooled around
with the paintings,

162
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:13,275
we probably could've reached
the fourth floor by now.

163
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,908
<i>Is that a Mimic?</i>

164
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:25,912
<i>I've never noticed that box there before.</i>

165
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:28,790
<i>It's not super obvious,
but it's not exactly hidden, either.</i>

166
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:30,917
<i>It's positioned in a way
that catches your eye.</i>

167
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:34,838
{\an8}<i>It's in a spot those bastards are fond of.</i>

168
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:39,134
{\an8}So, let's get some shut-eye here today.

169
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:40,093
{\an8}Okay.

170
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,471
{\an8}You good with that, Chilchuck?

171
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:43,930
{\an8}Sure.

172
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,519
<i>I suppose I don't have to tell them.</i>

173
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:52,981
<i>I just know Senshi and Laios
will insist on eating it.</i>

174
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:55,942
<i>Then, it'll be up to me to open the box.</i>

175
00:11:57,736 --> 00:11:59,112
{\an8}<i>Mimics...</i>

176
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:02,741
{\an8}<i>I've lost count of the times
those bastards have caused me misery!</i>

177
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:04,951
All right!

178
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:06,912
It doesn't have a lock or a trap!

179
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,753
Since this was locked, it's not a Mimic!

180
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:25,388
If I open it from behind,
it shouldn't be able to hurt me!

181
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:30,894
Dammit! I forgot about the trap!

182
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:37,400
<i>Damn Mimics!</i>

183
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,569
You okay?

184
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:42,072
You seemed lost in thought.

185
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:44,032
Is something bothering you?

186
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:46,076
No, not really.

187
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,953
You must be tired.

188
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:49,329
You're still a child, after all.

189
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:51,873
Let him have a good night's sleep
without having to stand guard.

190
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:54,334
Like I said, I'm not a kid!

191
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:56,336
So, how old are you?

192
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:57,587
I'd rather not say.

193
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:00,882
There you go again.
You're always like that.

194
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:03,593
You won't even tell us
your hometown or your birthday.

195
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:06,888
I prefer to keep my job
and personal life in separate lanes.

196
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:10,267
{\an8}One of these days, you'll miss out
if you keep acting that way.

197
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,018
{\an8}Sure, whatever.

198
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:20,902
<i>I've become more sensitive to hunger.</i>

199
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,113
<i>I used to be fine
without food for two days.</i>

200
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,701
<i>I'll go and fetch some water
from the next room.</i>

201
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:30,120
Hey, slowpoke.

202
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:34,124
I'm going to draw some water.

203
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:37,961
I'll go with you.

204
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,588
Don't bother. I'll be right back.

205
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:41,881
It's dangerous.

206
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,091
It's just the next room.

207
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,188
<i>A Coin Bug.</i>

208
00:13:57,272 --> 00:13:59,190
<i>I wonder if there's a nest nearby.</i>

209
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:02,902
<i>If I can find a few more,
it might help ease our hunger.</i>

210
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,990
<i>Not to sound like Laios,
but I kinda like Coin Bugs.</i>

211
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:10,285
<i>They're monsters
that camouflage like Mimics,</i>

212
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:11,286
<i>but they're cute.</i>

213
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:12,537
Hey!

214
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:14,873
Wait a minute, that's where the Mimic--

215
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,336
<i>You idiot.</i>

216
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:22,547
<i>You forgot you're heavier
with the water bag.</i>

217
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:25,383
<i>There should be a mechanism nearby
to open this door.</i>

218
00:14:27,594 --> 00:14:29,054
<i>Of course, it's out of reach.</i>

219
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,264
{\an8}<i>Should I call for help?</i>

220
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:35,769
{\an8}<i>If my yelling attracts more monsters,
it will put my friends in danger.</i>

221
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:36,728
{\an8}<i>Don't worry.</i>

222
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:39,147
{\an8}<i>If I don't return, Marcille will notice.</i>

223
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:41,858
<i>Will she? No, she probably won't.</i>

224
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:42,984
<i>I can't count on her!</i>

225
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,278
<i>Don't panic!</i>

226
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:47,405
<i>Opening closed doors</i>

227
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,574
<i>is your job, isn't it?</i>

228
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:53,411
<i>This type of door opens
once you figure out its mechanism.</i>

229
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:56,456
<i>I'll be safe
as long as I don't touch the Mimic.</i>

230
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:59,042
<i>I don't hear
any strange device making noise,</i>

231
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,418
<i>so there's no time limit, either.</i>

232
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:02,921
<i>There are a couple of buttons on the wall</i>

233
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:06,299
<i>and a mechanism
that likely triggers spears to pop up.</i>

234
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:08,927
<i>If I press the buttons in the wrong order,
they probably spring up.</i>

235
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:13,515
<i>And the text on this plate
is likely the key, but...</i>

236
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:17,060
<i>It's in some ancient language,
and I can't make heads or tails of it.</i>

237
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:19,604
<i>Darn it, if only Marcille were around.</i>

238
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,150
<i>But it seems strangely familiar...</i>

239
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:27,112
<i>Nah, I should get my
thoughts in order first.</i>

240
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:30,156
<i>There are three buttons
in the corners of the room.</i>

241
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,408
<i>Why three?</i>

242
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:33,743
<i>Do I need to press them
in a specific sequence?</i>

243
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,457
<i>There's a button behind the Mimic as well!</i>

244
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,669
<i>Darn it! That bastard
is set on hindering me at every turn!</i>

245
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:44,713
<i>Could there be a hint inside the room?</i>

246
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:47,382
<i>Of course not.</i>

247
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:50,760
<i>Even if I press the buttons randomly,
I'll only end up getting skewered.</i>

248
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:53,430
<i>But since I'm small,
maybe I could dodge them.</i>

249
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:55,598
<i>Nah, it's too risky.</i>

250
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:59,644
<i>Ugh, I have no idea what to do!</i>

251
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:07,444
{\an8}<i>Maybe I should just
stay still until dawn...</i>

252
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:11,906
You were in here?!

253
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,076
Darn--

254
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:22,542
Ow.

255
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:24,669
I-I was saved--

256
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:34,054
You sure are tough!

257
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:37,891
<i>Mimics are cute when you turn them over,
and they wiggle their legs.</i>

258
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:41,561
<i>You can tell their sex
by turning them over.</i>

259
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:45,565
<i>Laios' useless trivia
is coming back to me one after another!</i>

260
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:48,359
Turn them over?

261
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:50,195
As if that's possible!

262
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,698
<i>Here goes nothing!</i>

263
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,003
Ow.

264
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,714
I wonder if they're on their way
to help me after all that commotion.

265
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:11,841
Huh?

266
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,468
So this one was empty?

267
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:14,844
How dare you mock me like that!

268
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:16,387
Huh?

269
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:17,680
This text...

270
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,226
So this is what was written on the plate!

271
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,937
In that case, I know what it says!

272
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:25,480
Hurry!

273
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:27,482
- East!
- <i>No matter how many times the sun rises...</i>

274
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:28,983
- West!
- <i>And the moon sinks...</i>

275
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,860
- North!
- <i>Like the unmoving stars...</i>

276
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:33,404
South!

277
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:38,284
<i>May the wind of fortune
forever blow your way!</i>

278
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,496
It opened!

279
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:58,763
Chilchuck isn't coming back!

280
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,854
C-Chilchuck!

281
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:08,481
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

282
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:10,191
I'm alive, okay?

283
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:12,235
What's this?

284
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:14,445
Did you do this, Chilchuck?

285
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:15,738
Well done!

286
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,115
Sure.

287
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,576
What a fine Mimic.

288
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,870
A Mimic, huh?

289
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:23,621
It's going to be my first time cooking it.

290
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:26,416
Don't try to eat it
as if it's the normal thing to do!

291
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,877
Don't worry, Marcille.

292
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,920
Mimics on their own aren't poisonous.

293
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:34,174
They can be toxic depending on their diet,

294
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:38,094
but if you remove their digestive organs,
it should be safe.

295
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:41,639
How is that supposed to be safe?

296
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,142
Forget it, Marcille.

297
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:46,811
There's no point in telling them not to.

298
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:50,732
{\an8}But today, I won't eat it, no matter what!

299
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:57,071
Boil plenty of water,

300
00:18:57,822 --> 00:18:59,532
add some salt.

301
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:03,203
Place the Mimic inside,
cover it with a lid,

302
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:05,079
and wait a while.

303
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,142
When it's boiled enough,

304
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,353
{\an8}it's done!

305
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:30,980
{\an8}BOILED MIMIC

306
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:37,403
It's hard to scoop out the meat.

307
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:39,239
How about using the handle instead?

308
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:44,911
It's no good.
I'm only pushing it deeper inside.

309
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:45,954
Right.

310
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:48,915
Chilchuck, let me use those things.

311
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:49,874
Those things?

312
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,711
{\an8}You know, the picking tools
you're always carrying around.

313
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:56,172
{\an8}<i>Picking tools.</i>

314
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,386
A-Are you out of your mind?

315
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,430
{\an8}It should be fine
if we disinfect them in boiling water.

316
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,769
That's not the problem!

317
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:11,521
D-Don't!

318
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:18,528
It's easy to scoop now!

319
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:21,739
Here.

320
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:35,795
It's really good.

321
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:41,134
This is really tasty.

322
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:44,971
I bet it would be delicious to eat
the back meat and leg meat together.

323
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:48,266
It wasn't as good as I thought.

324
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,644
They say the digestive gland
of hermit crabs tastes bad.

325
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,899
But why didn't you tell us
about the Mimic?

326
00:20:57,483 --> 00:21:00,194
{\an8}I have unpleasant memories
associated with Mimics.

327
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:03,406
{\an8}Ideally, I'd like to steer clear
of them entirely.

328
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:06,534
Anyway, I've made
quite a few errors in judgment.

329
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:12,040
I panicked thinking
it might eat the Treasure Bug.

330
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:14,625
Mimics don't eat Treasure Bugs.

331
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:15,543
What?

332
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:18,588
<i>On the contrary,
Treasure Bugs feed on Mimics.</i>

333
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:20,006
<i>When they find a Mimic,</i>

334
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:22,258
<i>they enter the box through the crack
and lay their eggs.</i>

335
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:26,429
<i>And the larvae that hatch inside the box
grow as they consume the Mimic.</i>

336
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:28,389
<i>Once they become adult insects,</i>

337
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:30,808
<i>they're often confused
for treasure by humans,</i>

338
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:33,144
<i>and they take flight
to begin their next phase of life.</i>

339
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:35,605
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

340
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:37,815
{\an8}Cut it out, will you?

341
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,651
{\an8}That's what you get
for not telling me your age.

342
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:44,947
{\an8}Didn't you learn that you can miss out
when you keep secrets from your friends?

343
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:47,825
{\an8}Come on, tell me how old you are!

344
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,870
Th...

345
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:52,038
"Th..."?

346
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:56,042
This year, I turn 29.

347
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:01,964
So you really are a kid. How boring!

348
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:04,467
I didn't know you were so young.

349
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,719
Well, why don't you
tell me your ages, then!

350
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,180
This is what I hate
about long-lived races!

351
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:12,517
What?

352
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,186
Um, Mister... Chilchuck...

353
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,437
Stop it!

354
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,524
<i>Today, you feast on a monster,</i>

355
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:22,819
<i>but tomorrow,
you could end up as someone's meal.</i>

356
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:25,029
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

357
00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:27,615
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>
