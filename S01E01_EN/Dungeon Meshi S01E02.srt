MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,679
I'm back, Mom.

3
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:39,725
What's that?

4
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,227
It smells great.

5
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,939
That's because it's your birthday.

6
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,525
{\an8}It's all your favorite dishes.

7
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,777
Wow, really?

8
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,695
Time to eat up.

9
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,199
See? These are all your favorite...

10
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,202
ingredients from the dungeon.

11
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,457
What's wrong, Marcille?

12
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,127
I had a nightmare.

13
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,298
What's with this smell?

14
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,050
It's the same as in my dream.

15
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,886
Another party is making
breakfast over there.

16
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,180
They're grilling cured pork

17
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,723
and eating it.

18
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,225
I'm so jealous.

19
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,935
How truly terrible.

20
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,937
It's just so tragic.

21
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,021
100 PERSON SURVEY
ON DUNGEON MEALS

22
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,358
When it comes to meals
eaten by young adventurers nowadays,

23
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,278
they have bread, dried meat, and wine.

24
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,447
To build up stamina
for exploring the dungeon,

25
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,283
fat from meats is important.

26
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,034
But that alone is not enough.

27
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:42,204
Malnutrition is more terrifying
than monsters.

28
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,957
This may sound like a lecture,

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,461
but that doesn't mean
our meals are perfect either.

30
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:54,466
The young elven girl says
she's jealous of their pork,

31
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,386
but that's because her body wants fat.

32
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,221
I just don't want to eat monsters!

33
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,223
And so,

34
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,226
we'll hunt monsters high in fat today.

35
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,812
If we can find eggs, that's even better.

36
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,814
Eggs have all the nutrition you need.

37
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,233
We should proactively harvest them
in the dungeon.

38
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,028
{\an8}Are you thinking...

39
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,112
{\an8}Yeah, I am.

40
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,238
{\an8}What is it?

41
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,282
<i>The body of a chicken.</i>

42
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,159
<i>The tail of a snake.</i>

43
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,121
<i>A creature said to possess deadly venom
in its fangs and claws.</i>

44
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,790
<i>The Basilisk, king of snakes.</i>

45
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,627
Oh, a Basilisk.

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,212
Isn't that great, Marcille?

47
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,755
You'll get to eat chicken.

48
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,468
Is that chicken?
Does that really count as chicken?

49
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,553
Isn't it so cool?

50
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,765
I used to think it was cooler
when more species are mixed together.

51
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:47,353
But with only two types,
they bring out each other's strengths.

52
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:51,690
I even noticed the beauty of chicken,
something I used to only see as poultry.

53
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:54,235
It's a simple yet profound combination.

54
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,738
By the way, the Cockatrice
that nests deeper inside

55
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,990
is another kind of snake-tailed animal.

56
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,410
I've always dreamed
of comparing its taste with a Basilisk's.

57
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,371
Why would anyone want that?

58
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,582
That area is a Basilisk nest.

59
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,002
There it is.

60
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,588
Looks like they're freshly laid.

61
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,758
Let's snatch them up
while their mother's gone.

62
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,426
They're so long and narrow.

63
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,344
Hold this.

64
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,721
It's so soft.

65
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,099
A Basilisk cry.

66
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,642
Let's hurry, Senshi.

67
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,228
Wait, we got to wrap this in cloth.

68
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,899
It's the party from earlier.

69
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,721
That's the worst way to run away.

70
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,889
She's basically begging
to get her back kicked.

71
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,308
Go and save her already!

72
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,986
Spread your arms and legs out
to make your body look as big as possible

73
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,738
and make loud sounds to intimidate it.

74
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,741
That'll stop it from coming any further!

75
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,746
I want to pretend that
I'm not associated with him.

76
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,964
<i>Basilisks also have a head on their tail.</i>

77
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:42,217
<i>It doesn't seem to have a blind spot,
but it only has one body.</i>

78
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:45,304
<i>If you bait the heads with an attack
from two different directions,</i>

79
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,972
<i>the two brains will confuse the body...</i>

80
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,683
<i>for a single moment.</i>

81
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,564
How are his wounds?

82
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,483
Was he poisoned?

83
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,984
- Y-Yes.
- Laios.

84
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,653
Senshi says he has an antidote.

85
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:02,988
Really?

86
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:06,241
I want to use it in today's cooking.

87
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,993
- What?!
- What?!

88
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,245
But this guy's hanging on by a thread!

89
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,664
Instead of taking the antidote alone,

90
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,999
it's tastier when cooked.

91
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,626
{\an8}Then cook it already!

92
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,796
<i>First, cut off the tail and feet.</i>

93
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,882
<i>Blanch it a bit and pluck its feathers.</i>

94
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,261
It's chicken now.

95
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:29,681
<i>Take its innards out
and rub your spices on it.</i>

96
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,310
<i>Stuff it with veggies
and finely chopped herbs</i>

97
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,062
<i>and tie up the opening.</i>

98
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,481
<i>Put a skewer through the meat</i>

99
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,566
<i>and roast it thoroughly.</i>

100
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,068
It's done.

101
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,028
Hurry, feed it to him.

102
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,578
The meat's overflowing with juices.
It's delicious.

103
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,080
Sorry about all that.

104
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,290
You all should eat too.

105
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,458
Hold on.

106
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,335
I got to cast a healing spell first...

107
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,259
This is so good!
I could see this at a restaurant in town.

108
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,594
It tastes exactly like chicken.

109
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,222
I heard snake meat
is similar to chicken too.

110
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,810
Sorry, I'll cast my healing spell now.

111
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:15,727
Oops, wrong item.

112
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,859
I've never had a proper meal
like this before in a dungeon.

113
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,154
Um...

114
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:30,117
It's been three months
since we started challenging this dungeon,

115
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,620
but we keep getting wiped out
at the same place.

116
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:39,126
{\an8}How do we become strong enough
to cook monsters like you all?

117
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,044
Well, that's...

118
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,255
First, improve your diet.

119
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,257
Rethink your circadian rhythm.

120
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,259
And engage in proper exercise.

121
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,887
If you pay attention to
these three things,

122
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,639
your body will naturally get stronger.

123
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,852
<i>What incredible people.</i>

124
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,104
Let's do our best too.

125
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,112
Reaching the third floor today
might be impossible.

126
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,698
It's because we took
our sweet time on that roast.

127
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,368
Apparently, the Red Dragon wakes up
once a month to go hunting.

128
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,788
That was probably
when we ran into it the other day.

129
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,958
Then he's sleeping on a full stomach now.

130
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:23,295
I'd like to find him
before he gets an empty stomach.

131
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,214
That's why, Marcille,

132
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,424
it'd be great
if we could move things along.

133
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,680
Won't be easy at this rate.

134
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,225
I'm totally fine.

135
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,227
I can easily walk more.

136
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,311
Don't push yourself.

137
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,562
Let's rest a bit.

138
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,897
I'm not pushing myself!

139
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,023
Hey, listen.

140
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,400
If you try to act tough now,

141
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:49,154
you'll just hurt yourself
and become a burden, got it?

142
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,906
SHOCK

143
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,825
It might be easier
to use a different path.

144
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,078
But the Big Bat outside
will be in our way.

145
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,997
I can use magic on the Big Bats.

146
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,249
No, that's okay.

147
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,584
What about a secret passageway?

148
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,670
More traps, but fewer monsters.

149
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,421
I have trap-disarming spells...

150
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,091
It's faster if Chilchuck disarms them.

151
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,303
We're taking a path
with fewer monsters, huh?

152
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,973
We should secure some foodstuffs then.

153
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,392
Can't we get by on today's leftovers?

154
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,893
We only have meat and eggs.

155
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,728
We need vegetables.

156
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,314
There's a Mandrake colony near here.

157
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:28,235
Me! I know how to harvest Mandrakes!

158
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,486
Leave it to me!

159
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,657
Mandrakes are fundamental
in magic and medicine.

160
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,118
In other words, my area of expertise.

161
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,662
Everyone, listen to me this time.

162
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,665
Mandrakes scream
when you pull them from the dirt.

163
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,668
It'll make you go insane
or even cause death.

164
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,337
We would get wiped out

165
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,591
and be one step further from saving Falin.

166
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,426
To prevent that...

167
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,263
First, we need a string
and a well-trained dog.

168
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,180
A dog?

169
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:01,935
We'll tie the Mandrake to the dog's collar
and call the dog over from a distance.

170
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,771
Then, the Mandrake
will be pulled out by the dog.

171
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,857
What'll happen to the dog?

172
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,859
It'll die.

173
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,110
That's awful.

174
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,153
But also,

175
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,113
where are we going to get a dog?

176
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:16,783
And that method
doesn't seem very efficient.

177
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,702
But at school, we...

178
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,871
Can't we use a long string?

179
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,788
Huh?

180
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,625
Use a string so long
that we won't hear it scream.

181
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,460
Then we won't need a dog.

182
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:27,961
What?

183
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,130
I'm pretty sure we can't.

184
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,841
Maybe because it's hard to pull?

185
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,933
That scared me.

186
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,685
Was that Marcille?

187
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,898
It won't scream
if you cut its head off beforehand.

188
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,232
That's true.

189
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,068
No, that's too dangerous.

190
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,320
That's how I've eaten them for many years.

191
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,406
That kind of novice mentality
brings the most danger.

192
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,242
But Senshi actually has experience.

193
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,163
Have you ever tried
the method according to the book?

194
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,666
<i>No. I feel so bad for the dog.</i>

195
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,170
Either way, we don't have a dog
nor the time for this.

196
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,672
Sorry, but let's learn how Senshi does it.

197
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,092
<i>If it were that easy,</i>

198
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,677
<i>you'd think it'd be written
in the handbook.</i>

199
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,513
<i>But he's right.</i>

200
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,099
<i>It's not convincing
when I'm only reading from a book.</i>

201
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,684
<i>I shouldn't have them do
something I haven't tried myself.</i>

202
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,687
<i>Something I haven't tried?</i>

203
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,190
<i>Then I'll just have to show them.</i>

204
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,193
<i>I'll prove that my method makes sense.</i>

205
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,028
I'm sorry, Marcille!

206
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,196
I forgive you.

207
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,116
<i>But since I can't use a dog...</i>

208
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,450
<i>A monster!</i>

209
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,870
<i>The monsters in this area are Big Bats.</i>

210
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,956
<i>They should be asleep right now.</i>

211
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,293
<i>I wonder if this will work.</i>

212
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,462
<i>It didn't say how hard you have to pull.</i>

213
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,299
<i>Big Bat nests can be found
through their droppings.</i>

214
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,386
<i>Laios's library of knowledge
is actually coming in handy.</i>

215
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,973
<i>And a place
you can't hear the screams from</i>

216
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,683
<i>would be that tower.</i>

217
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,900
Focus on the target...

218
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,656
<i>Aire Faum Orbis!</i>

219
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:30,750
All right!

220
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:35,464
What's that?

221
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,631
Marcille?

222
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,348
Wait.

223
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:46,892
Wait...

224
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,644
<i>It really is important
to try things first.</i>

225
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,313
<i>If anything,</i>

226
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,025
<i>now I know why Big Bats
shouldn't be used to replace dogs.</i>

227
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,028
Marcille!

228
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,071
Did she die?

229
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,201
She's alive.

230
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,122
Using a Big Bat instead of a dog?

231
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,290
What an idiot.

232
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,711
Hey, Marcille. Can you hear me?

233
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,714
Yes, I am very well.

234
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,965
No, you're not.

235
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,634
She heard the scream.

236
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,052
Let's keep talking with her.

237
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,054
She'll slowly snap out of it.

238
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,556
Why did you do this?

239
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,017
I panicked when I was told
I'd be a burden,

240
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,935
No wait...

241
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,730
...so I wanted to stick it to you guys
and make you bow down to me.

242
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,981
What the heck?

243
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,066
Chilchuck.

244
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,946
I felt alone since I couldn't be
of help to everyone.

245
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,868
The monsters get stronger
as we go deeper into the dungeon.

246
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,621
The thing I can depend on most
is your magic,

247
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,291
so I didn't want to use it up
on such an early floor.

248
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,836
And everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

249
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,548
I want to rely on your strengths.

250
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,467
Someone else will cover
for your weaknesses.

251
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,720
You can depend on us more.

252
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,975
Tell her, Chilchuck.

253
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,730
I really think having you here with us
is a huge help.

254
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,237
Put more feeling into it.

255
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,990
When did you get back to normal?!

256
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:29,244
I didn't expect a Big Bat too.
What a surprising catch.

257
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,496
How about we make some omelets today?

258
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,333
Is this really a Basilisk egg?

259
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,752
It's completely different
from chicken eggs.

260
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,588
That's how snake eggs are.

261
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,673
Only its tail was a snake.

262
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,633
Its head and body were a chicken.

263
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,802
No, the tail was a chicken.

264
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,137
BODY, TAIL

265
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,891
The color on this one
is different from the rest.

266
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,267
You're right.

267
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,270
Marcille got that one
since it still has a head.

268
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,735
<i>Chop up the Mandrake and sauté it well.</i>

269
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,237
<i>Cover it with the egg.</i>

270
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,531
<i>Once it fluffs up...</i>

271
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,866
It's done.

272
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,535
MANDRAKE AND BASILISK OMELET

273
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,204
The yellow is
way darker than a chicken egg.

274
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,874
This is the Mandrake we harvested.

275
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,544
This one uses the Mandrake
harvested by the elven girl.

276
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,130
You shouldn't rub salt in someone's wound.

277
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,048
Now, now.

278
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,721
Marcille's isn't bitter,
and it has a mild taste.

279
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,389
Yeah, it's delicious.

280
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:35,060
The screaming must have gotten
the bitterness out.

281
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,897
It's basic cooking knowledge
that going the extra mile improves a dish.

282
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,900
It seems I only sought efficiency

283
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,152
and lost sight of what truly matters.

284
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,904
Thank you, Marcille.

285
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,823
Your knowledge and book are superb.

286
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,742
This isn't a cookbook, you know.

287
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,828
Take this small gift as my thanks.

288
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,414
You can have the most delicious part.

289
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,336
I don't want it!

290
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,674
I'm sick and tired of eating monsters!

291
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,262
Is the shortcut entrance around here?

292
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,263
The entrance?

293
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,182
Laios, give me your sword.

294
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,273
It's here.

295
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,822
What just happened?

296
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,367
Chilchuck is an expert
in detecting traps and picking locks.

297
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,745
Just so you know,
there will be traps everywhere,

298
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,914
so don't do anything unless I tell you to.

299
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,044
What I hate the most

300
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,547
are those who get in the way of my work.

301
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,016
Hold it.

302
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,783
These tiles are safe to step on.

303
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,169
What the heck was that?

304
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,880
I told you to only step
where I told you to.

305
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,632
Your foot's sticking out by so much.

306
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,509
I don't like complicated stuff.

307
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,094
Who cares what you like?

308
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,388
You've got to be more careful.

309
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,184
Some traps are connected
and affect other traps.

310
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,395
If one thing shifts,
all my calculations go out the window.

311
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,648
Just move wherever I tell you to.

312
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,535
Such firepower.

313
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,453
I see.

314
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,455
Traps come in many shapes and forms.

315
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,998
Move your foot already.

316
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,251
Fire traps usually come
as a set with gas or oil.

317
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,169
Oil.

318
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,296
We don't need a dwarf roast.

319
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:09,923
A roast.

320
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,841
No, wait.

321
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,843
Deep-fried food.

322
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:14,928
Fried.

323
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,263
<i>Kakiage</i>!

324
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,642
We'll have tempura for lunch today.

325
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,603
Where's the oil trap?

326
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,480
It's not meant for cooking.

327
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,273
Half-foot child.

328
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,609
You are no expert on oil.

329
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,486
I'm not a child.

330
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,781
Vegetable oil is simple
and the highest in supply.

331
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,449
Anyhow, show me the oil.

332
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,952
I'll give up
if it isn't meant for cooking.

333
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,497
Fine.

334
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,873
In exchange,

335
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,377
promise you'll follow
my orders around the traps.

336
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,131
{\an8}I won't help you
if you don't accept this condition.

337
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,174
I swear it.

338
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,926
I'll help too, if needed.

339
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,136
I won't need it.

340
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,262
{\an8}Listen.

341
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,264
{\an8}We each have our own job.

342
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,267
{\an8}Yours is cooking.
Mine is detecting traps and picking locks.

343
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,144
Marcille's is magic.

344
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,230
I don't say anything
about your cooking methods.

345
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,733
So, please stop interfering with my work.

346
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,864
The treasure vault.

347
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:19,784
The excessive number of traps here
must be to keep out intruders.

348
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,913
They're secured onto the ground.

349
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,583
I guess I'll try opening one.

350
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,794
Go over there.

351
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,673
He's usually the most mature one.

352
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,676
Having his companions' lives in his hands

353
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,429
is probably putting him on edge.

354
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:42,599
It's open.

355
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,102
I see. How do we get the oil out?

356
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,562
I don't know.

357
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,106
This is the spout.

358
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,360
Pulling this trigger will release the oil,
but I don't know how much.

359
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,571
I'll have my pot ready then.

360
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,239
Pull the trigger.

361
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,158
No way.

362
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,743
It's probably boiling oil.

363
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,119
Don't be afraid.

364
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,245
I <i>am</i> afraid.

365
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,125
Don't come crying to me later!

366
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,922
So hot!

367
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,216
I told you so.

368
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,426
Are you okay, Senshi?

369
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,802
Your finger's in it!

370
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,681
It's 180 degrees. Perfect for frying food.

371
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,643
You're the type that's okay with heat?

372
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,563
The smell and taste
tell me that it's olive oil.

373
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,564
For real?

374
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,817
They do say this area
originally produced olives.

375
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,320
It's not surprising
that it's used in traps.

376
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,198
You think so?

377
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,533
Either way, I can fry food with this.

378
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,451
Oh, right!

379
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,913
Can we use the blade
from the trap earlier to cut the meat?

380
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,083
No, we don't know
if it'll fall in the exact same place.

381
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,378
I'll leave it to you.

382
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,381
After all, I don't know
how to handle the traps.

383
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,216
Why should I?

384
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,512
Cooking is my job,
so you should follow my directions.

385
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,223
I believe that was our deal.

386
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,725
I never said that.

387
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,403
<i>What am I doing?</i>

388
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,823
I cut the Big Bat.

389
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:22,740
Okay.

390
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:27,370
Next, go heat up this oil
at the fire trap from earlier.

391
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,956
What's wrong? Hurry along.

392
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,714
<i>Cut off the Big Bat's thick outer layer
and chop the meat into chunks.</i>

393
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,382
<i>Lightly score the meat,</i>

394
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,884
<i>massage the seasoning in, and let it rest.</i>

395
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,263
<i>Meanwhile, let's prepare
the Mandrake</i> kakiage.

396
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,516
<i>When you peel the Mandrake skin,</i>

397
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,435
<i>it's best to pull the limbs off first.</i>

398
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,687
<i>You can tear them off by hand
if you unravel them.</i>

399
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,522
<i>Completely peel the body</i>

400
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,859
<i>and lightly scrape
the darker parts off the limbs.</i>

401
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,777
<i>Then, we prepare the batter.</i>

402
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,739
<i>Mix a Basilisk egg into the water</i>

403
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,699
<i>and sift flour into the mixture.</i>

404
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,617
<i>Avoid clumps while mixing it</i>

405
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,661
<i>and put the Mandrake in.</i>

406
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,955
How's the fire going?

407
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,290
How would I know?

408
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,376
I've never had to adjust
a trap's firepower before, darn it.

409
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,213
Looks just right.

410
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,138
When it looks like
it won't fall apart, flip it.

411
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,139
Got it?

412
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,307
Okay.

413
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,896
Is it ready?

414
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,940
Dang it. It was too soon.

415
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,901
Maybe the fire's too weak.

416
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:44,739
It burned.

417
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,240
How's it looking?

418
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,284
It's going horribly.
Can you take it from here?

419
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,911
The fire trap is your job.

420
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,539
I can adjust the fire,
but isn't frying part of your job?

421
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,708
It turns gooey if the fire is weak,

422
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,002
but it burns if it's too strong.

423
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,214
That must mean
it's not a trap-related issue, huh?

424
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,257
Looks almost ready.

425
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:06,803
The color turned out nicely.

426
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,263
It's done.

427
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,265
MANDRAKE AND BIG BAT KAKIAGE

428
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:15,144
I never imagined I could eat
fried food in a dungeon like this.

429
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,397
It's fried really well.

430
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,066
We had a good firepower.

431
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,069
You must aim to fry food quickly
with the right temperature.

432
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,612
It gets nice and crispy.

433
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,990
That's pretty hard to do
with an open fire.

434
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,618
I don't think people would do this
on an open fire.

435
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:34,831
I pass by here often, but who knew
such a convenient room was here?

436
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,834
Listen up.

437
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,336
Don't try this without me here.

438
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,838
You'll die for sure.

439
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,089
I know.

440
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,509
I can never imitate
your trap manipulation skills.

441
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,136
It's truly amazing.

442
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,180
When we go our separate ways someday,

443
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:54,934
it's unfortunate that I won't be able
to use that trap alone.

444
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,355
I guess I have no choice.

445
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,482
When we have some spare time,

446
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,359
I'll teach you a bit about traps.

447
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,527
Are you sure?

448
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,029
I'm kind of reluctant to do so.

449
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:12,326
{\an8}But you know,
you taught me how to cook, Senshi.

450
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,122
<i>Bread cannot replace meat.</i>

451
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,457
<i>Nor can meat replace bread.</i>

452
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,419
<i>But together, they taste even better.</i>

453
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:27,300
<i>Both food and people remain the same.</i>

454
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,885
<i>Dungeon food.</i>
