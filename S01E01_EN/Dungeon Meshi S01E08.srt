1
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:26,883
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:40,438
I overslept!

3
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:50,991
I can't hear his heartbeat.

4
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:53,994
Of course, you can't hear it
from over his armor.

5
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:57,497
He finally managed to fall asleep
a little while ago.

6
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:02,002
Seems like the food poisoning symptoms
are letting up as well.

7
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:05,505
I see. So, I made a fuss over nothing.

8
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:07,591
Let him sleep a little longer.

9
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:10,010
It seems he was delirious
all throughout the night.

10
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:14,514
You know, here in this dungeon,
even the number of monsters

11
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:16,892
that are defeated by intruders
are taken into account.

12
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:18,852
Even when we defeat monsters,

13
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:21,521
we're only maintaining
the balance of the ecosystem.

14
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:25,859
But if we let them be,
the monsters will wander into towns.

15
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:29,905
And the towns will hire adventurers
to hunt the monsters.

16
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,033
It's designed so well.

17
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,160
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,787
The design of the dungeon, of course.

19
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:42,417
I studied it in school a long time ago.

20
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:44,669
But it was really tricky.

21
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:47,255
Hey, look.

22
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:51,051
That's Marcille
from the graduate school, isn't it?

23
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:53,720
The most brilliant female student
in the school's history!

24
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:57,682
I heard she assisted a teacher
on her very first day here.

25
00:02:57,682 --> 00:03:01,144
And I heard she's already on track
to become the court mage.

26
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:03,146
Wow, that's amazing!

27
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:07,943
I didn't start as a teacher's assistant
until my fifth day of school,

28
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:11,196
and as for becoming a court mage,
it's just that my parent used to be one.

29
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:17,327
Today, I asked the teacher
to let me join the class.

30
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:19,579
I hope we can get along.

31
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:23,083
- Y-Yeah!
- Y-Yeah!

32
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,587
Today, we will try
a spirit breeding experiment.

33
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:30,966
Everyone, take a jar each and go outside.

34
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:35,220
<i>Prepare wooden planks with holes in them</i>

35
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:40,100
<i>and place them inside a jar,
sandwiching them between layers of soil.</i>

36
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:43,228
<i>Create a barrier,</i>

37
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:47,232
<i>fill the jar with magic,</i>

38
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:49,818
<i>and release the spirits into it.</i>

39
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,740
<i>The tiny spirits live solely
on the magic inside the jar.</i>

40
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,244
<i>If the magic is too strong or too weak,
they will die.</i>

41
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:02,956
<i>Breeding spirits is considered
the foundation of summoning magic.</i>

42
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:06,710
<i>Because its structure resembles that
of a dungeon that houses monsters,</i>

43
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,004
<i>it's referred to as a "dungeonium."</i>

44
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:12,257
When you're done,
place your jar inside the darkroom.

45
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:15,051
We'll check on them a week from now.

46
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:19,889
Wow, your barrier is so pretty, Marcille!

47
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:22,017
Are you sure this is your first time?

48
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:25,311
But why are you studying summoning magic?

49
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:28,023
It's not your main field of study, is it?

50
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:31,818
I'm researching how
to create a safe dungeon.

51
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:34,571
Right now, I'm focused
on the ingredients of magic.

52
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,531
For example,

53
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:40,618
<i>the way we currently gather Mandrakes
is quite dangerous.</i>

54
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,747
But if I can design a safe dungeon

55
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:46,791
and grow only
beneficial monsters inside it,

56
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,836
I believe I could contribute to society.

57
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:51,463
Wow.

58
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,048
That's so cool.

59
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:55,091
Check out Marcille's barrier!

60
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,384
It's so beautiful!

61
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:58,011
I want to see it, too!

62
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,554
Let me see!

63
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:00,972
Watch out!

64
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:05,435
Are you okay?

65
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,062
T-Thanks.

66
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:13,318
<i>The soil has impurities mixed in,</i>

67
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:16,821
<i>and there are many gaps in the barrier,
causing the magic to weaken.</i>

68
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:20,200
<i>At this rate, the spirits inside
won't be able to survive for long.</i>

69
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:23,203
I hope your uniform didn't get dirty.

70
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:26,414
That girl is always covered in mud,

71
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:29,209
and she keeps skipping class,
so she's always lagging behind.

72
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,842
Everyone, retrieve your jars

73
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:41,471
and check how many spirits
are still alive.

74
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:44,307
Oh no, they're all dead!

75
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:46,184
They're just barely alive.

76
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:47,894
I bred a new spirit species!

77
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:48,978
That's mold.

78
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:54,067
<i>If there are many spirits still alive,
the fire will burn strongly.</i>

79
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,239
Yours are almost in the same condition
as they were a week ago.

80
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,449
Good work.

81
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:10,416
M-My jar!

82
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,128
Your spirits have multiplied quite a lot.

83
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:14,963
What should I do?

84
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:17,173
I'll take care of it.

85
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:20,885
How did you manage to do that?

86
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:23,388
I-I'm sorry.

87
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:26,724
There's this place
that's always teeming with spirits,

88
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:29,894
and I thought that using it
as a reference might work.

89
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:32,397
Teeming with spirits?

90
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:33,648
Where is this place?

91
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:35,900
U-Um...

92
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,736
This jar likely has just as many spirits
as you'd find in a dungeon.

93
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:41,573
This will make a splendid sample.

94
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:47,162
It's inside a real dungeon.

95
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:52,542
This is where I sneak outside.

96
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,795
A hidden passage?

97
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:21,237
Are you always doing stuff like this?

98
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:22,322
Yup!

99
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,076
So, that's why you're lagging behind.

100
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:38,546
A grasshopper!

101
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:40,423
Raspberries!

102
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:45,178
Don't eat something so mysterious!

103
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:48,181
Don't touch them, either!
They could be poisonous and dangerous!

104
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:51,184
T-They're not mysterious.

105
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:54,437
Grasshoppers and raspberries
aren't poisonous, either.

106
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:01,903
It's a real dungeon.

107
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,155
I've never seen one before.

108
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:09,285
<i>There's stagnant magic here,
and the air is still.</i>

109
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:11,663
<i>It's a naturally formed cave.</i>

110
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:14,582
Hey, it's dangerous!

111
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:21,339
Don't worry.

112
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,383
I come here often.

113
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:25,802
You'll be safe as long as you
stay on the dry ground.

114
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,198
Wow.

115
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:51,703
Dungeons really are teeming with spirits.

116
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:57,500
I took the soil and water from here
and placed them inside my jar.

117
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,461
I see.

118
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:03,131
What do you usually do when you come here?

119
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:07,635
I write letters and read books.

120
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:11,347
<i>So, this is totally the result
of her slacking off.</i>

121
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:17,353
<i>Anyway, this place seems pretty safe.</i>

122
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:19,772
<i>Hold on.</i>

123
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:23,359
<i>If I cultivate this place
and plant Mandrakes,</i>

124
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:26,279
<i>I'll be able to use
the dungeon's magic safely.</i>

125
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:29,115
<i>Yes, it should work.</i>

126
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,534
<i>It's a good distance
from the water as well.</i>

127
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,206
S-Slime!

128
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:40,126
We should burn all monsters!

129
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:41,210
N-No!

130
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,591
What did you do that for?

131
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:52,013
It won't venture into a sunlit area.

132
00:09:56,142 --> 00:10:00,521
Slimes break down bat droppings
and convert them into magic.

133
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:05,693
Without them,
the dungeon will wither away.

134
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:09,947
Bats...

135
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:11,616
Here.

136
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:26,005
<i>It's good.</i>

137
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:30,718
<i>If they taste this good,
I'm sure other animals eat them, too.</i>

138
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:35,056
<i>I wonder what the bats here eat.</i>

139
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:39,018
<i>When do these raspberries bear fruit?</i>

140
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,229
<i>What animals feed on them?</i>

141
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:46,109
<i>Without knowing that,
I won't be able to design a dungeon.</i>

142
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:53,032
<i>There's so much I don't know.</i>

143
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,663
Thanks for bringing me here.

144
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,961
I thought all I had to do
was study magic to improve.

145
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:07,547
But it seems like I was mistaken.

146
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,718
By the way, um...

147
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:16,472
I'm Falin. What's your name?

148
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,315
I'm Marcille.

149
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:29,944
Falin, I'd love to be friends with you.

150
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:34,198
The most brilliant female student
in the school's history?

151
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:35,616
That's gotta be false.

152
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:37,243
It's true!

153
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,620
Back in school,
I was a top-notch student, you know!

154
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:44,876
Anyway, this dungeon
is a mind-boggling place.

155
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:47,879
It's calculated to a tee,

156
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,923
and continuously circulates
enormous amounts of magic.

157
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:54,177
If this lunatic magician really exists,

158
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,888
he's definitely far from being sane.

159
00:11:57,472 --> 00:12:00,892
Senshi, it would be best for you
to find another place to live.

160
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,019
That's none of your concern.

161
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,771
In the first place, you hate magic,

162
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:08,774
but this dungeon itself
is constructed from magic!

163
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,277
I can't hear you.

164
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:13,738
I see.

165
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:16,032
So she was talking about you.

166
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:20,953
When my sister
had just enrolled in magic school,

167
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:23,789
her letters to me were full of worry.

168
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,710
<i>But ever since
she told me that she had made a friend,</i>

169
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,087
<i>it seemed like she was enjoying every day.</i>

170
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:34,300
She said you were an amazing person.

171
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,802
She was always complimenting you.

172
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:44,852
She complimented you, too.

173
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:46,562
She said she respected you.

174
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:48,940
Did she, now?

175
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:52,151
What's he good at?

176
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:55,029
He's really good at imitating a dog.

177
00:12:56,197 --> 00:13:00,159
<i>Oh, well, I guess
this isn't the time to be whining.</i>

178
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,202
All right.

179
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:04,163
Let's go and rescue Falin
as soon as we can!

180
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:07,500
Come on!

181
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,044
If you're awake, get up already!

182
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,422
Here's where we are now.

183
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:17,677
And this is the place the orcs mentioned
where the Red Dragon was spotted.

184
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,512
It should take us
about two days to get there.

185
00:13:20,054 --> 00:13:22,390
The dragon probably
won't stay in one place,

186
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,434
but it's not the sort of monster
that roams around, either.

187
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,145
Ideally, we'll set up camp
only two times more.

188
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,523
Once at the halfway point

189
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,942
and then again just before
we reach the Red Dragon.

190
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:36,279
We'll kick Laios out of bed
when the candle burns out.

191
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,114
Make sure to be ready.

192
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:40,449
Our next break
is going to be a little way off.

193
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,120
I want to wipe myself down.

194
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:46,747
Where?

195
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:48,374
I'll do it in the corner of the room.

196
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,377
Be quick about it.

197
00:13:55,673 --> 00:13:57,883
We'll be waiting outside.

198
00:13:57,883 --> 00:14:00,011
You can stay here.

199
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:01,637
I can do it clothed, you know.

200
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:04,473
If you say so.

201
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:08,978
<i>I'm bothering them, aren't I?</i>

202
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:13,316
<i>Maybe I should've studied illusion magic.</i>

203
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:15,651
<i>But that's not the issue, is it?</i>

204
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:18,779
<i>It was easier when half of us were girls.</i>

205
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,490
<i>This is where we part.</i>

206
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:24,952
What? Do you really have to leave now?

207
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:28,205
We still don't know
what happened to Falin.

208
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:33,502
Sorry, but we have to make a living, too.

209
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,632
<i>Just thinking about it is making me upset.</i>

210
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:39,717
<i>And I thought they were our friends!</i>

211
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,140
Get up, Laios!

212
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,808
Hey, wake up!

213
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:49,268
It's time to go!

214
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:52,229
There.

215
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:55,524
Oops. I boiled too much water.

216
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:23,803
U...

217
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:25,596
Undine!

218
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:31,352
What is it?

219
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:35,147
My staff!

220
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:44,281
My Water-Walk...

221
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:46,158
The water is moving.

222
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:48,995
You can't use weapons! We need fire.

223
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:49,912
Fire?

224
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:53,124
I could start a fire.

225
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:55,918
Marcille, do something on your own!

226
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,087
Easier said than done.

227
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,673
I hope I can hit it.

228
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:23,487
Marcille, don't just stand there!

229
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,823
Stay away from the water!

230
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:28,242
Your Water-Walk effects have worn off!

231
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,709
Marcille!

232
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,711
This is bad! Keep moving!

233
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,972
<i>I can't get away from it with this leg.</i>

234
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:59,148
<i>Where is it hiding?</i>

235
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,953
She's moving so slowly.
I can't bear to watch!

236
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:14,747
Just give me a moment to start a fire!

237
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:16,999
<i>It won't be ready in time...</i>

238
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:21,796
<i>I'm running low on magic.</i>

239
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:24,590
<i>I have to make my next attack count.</i>

240
00:17:29,845 --> 00:17:31,138
<i>Where is it?</i>

241
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,140
<i>Where is it?</i>

242
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:36,018
<i>There must be some sort of sign.</i>

243
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:38,646
<i>There!</i>

244
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:41,190
<i>It's colored with blood.</i>

245
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:43,359
It's so fast.

246
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,201
Marcille!

247
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:11,095
Hey.

248
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:13,597
It's...

249
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,435
There's only one thing to do.

250
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,858
Run!

251
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:31,574
Marcille, how are you doing?

252
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,579
I stopped the bleeding,
but I'm low on blood and magic.

253
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,455
I can't make a full recovery.

254
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,499
Sorry.

255
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:41,458
Don't be.

256
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,169
Rest for a bit.

257
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:45,212
Yeah.

258
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:49,466
I should've paid more attention
to Falin's healing magic lessons.

259
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:51,969
Hey, Laios.

260
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:55,514
What do we do now?

261
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:59,185
We can't continue on
with a mage out of magic.

262
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:02,897
And we can't move forward
without Water-Walk either.

263
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:05,232
Let's wait
for other adventurers to come by.

264
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,235
One of them might be a healer or a mage.

265
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:13,282
You really think a helpful adventurer
will just happen to show up?

266
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:15,618
We don't even have anything
to offer in return anyway.

267
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,913
The only thing we have is Kelpie meat.

268
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,123
Better hope our adventurer
is starving, then.

269
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:24,335
This source of nutrition
is a precious rarity in this dungeon.

270
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:27,046
That's beside the point!

271
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:29,632
Meat.

272
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:32,676
Do you have its liver as well?

273
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:34,011
Of course.

274
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:37,139
After all, the liver is rich in iron.

275
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,685
Iron...

276
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:43,020
This means...

277
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:46,482
- A barbecue!
- A barbecue!

278
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:56,533
Mane, neck, liver,

279
00:19:56,533 --> 00:20:01,538
ribs, tail, round, loin,

280
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,165
and vegetables.

281
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:07,169
KELPIE GRILLED MEAT

282
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:08,921
Marcille.

283
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:10,798
Marcille.

284
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:14,176
Can you sit up?

285
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:16,929
We prepared something nice for you.

286
00:20:33,404 --> 00:20:34,321
Round meat.

287
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:36,323
What about the liver?

288
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:39,702
The guts should be cooked thoroughly.

289
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:46,083
Sorry, Marcille. I'll be eating first.

290
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:51,088
It's not so gamey.

291
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:54,091
Yeah, it's a bit stringy, but it's good.

292
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:57,803
Does it taste more like a horse
or a marine animal?

293
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:01,598
It's too bad I haven't had the chance
to try either, so I can't say.

294
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:03,225
Rib meat.

295
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:05,853
The fat tastes sweet.

296
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:07,438
It's so soft.

297
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,107
Marcille, the liver is done.

298
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:11,775
Tenderloin meat.

299
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:15,029
It melts in your mouth.

300
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:16,363
I love this.

301
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:18,615
More liver for you, Marcille.

302
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,409
Tail meat.

303
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:22,119
It's good.

304
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,705
It tastes pretty interesting.

305
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:26,248
Have more, Marcille.

306
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:29,001
More liver, Marcille.

307
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:30,627
Is it good, Marcille?

308
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:32,254
Eat up, Marcille.

309
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:34,298
How do you like it, Marcille?

310
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:44,224
Let me eat the other parts, too!

311
00:21:49,188 --> 00:21:51,357
Looks like she's regained some energy.

312
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:53,025
Liver sure is potent.

313
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:56,528
But what are we going to do
about her magic shortage?

314
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:59,531
If only there was a meat
that could replenish magic.

315
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:02,284
Why did you stuff magic grass
in a Basilisk?

316
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:04,787
I believe it was the best choice.

317
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,919
Is it just me,
or do you also smell something?

318
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:13,921
It's coming from below.

319
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:15,589
What is that smell?

320
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:18,467
Is it the scent of grilling meat?

321
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,552
Someone must be cooking.

322
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:23,722
What, seriously?

323
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,808
What kind of fool

324
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:29,228
cooks meat in a place like this?
