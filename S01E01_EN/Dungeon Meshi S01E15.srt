1
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,846
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:31,872
Dammit!

3
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:32,998
What the hell?

4
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:35,751
This wall wasn't here on our way down!

5
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:38,212
Another earthquake?

6
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:40,005
Not an earthquake.

7
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:42,633
The dungeon is shifting
and changing its layout.

8
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:45,636
It's probably that magician's doing.

9
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,389
Maybe he's on the lookout for us.

10
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:52,685
You mean he's been making us
wander around in circles this whole time?

11
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:55,396
Maybe it's worth taking a little risk.

12
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,148
Give me a minute.

13
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:06,907
It's gone now.

14
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:11,745
Climbing over walls
might not be a smart move.

15
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:14,248
Guess we'll have to pick our way out.

16
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,545
Anyway, is it just me...

17
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:22,840
or is the city starting to bustle?

18
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:24,842
With the Red Dragon dead,

19
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:27,052
the lurking monsters
are starting to show themselves.

20
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:29,805
This level was originally
crawling with monsters.

21
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,725
We're lucky we didn't
bump into any until now.

22
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:37,438
Hey, are you okay?

23
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:40,274
<i>This isn't good.</i>

24
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:42,651
<i>We've been trekking without a break,</i>

25
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:44,778
<i>and we haven't had
a decent meal since that Dragon.</i>

26
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,531
<i>How old is Laios?</i>

27
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,659
<i>I'm not sure if he's getting up there
or still in his youth,</i>

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,538
<i>but Chilchuck and Marcille
are likely still growing.</i>

29
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:55,456
Come on.

30
00:02:55,539 --> 00:03:01,045
<i>It's downright shameful not being able
to provide them with proper meals.</i>

31
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:02,296
<i>I must feed them.</i>

32
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,298
<i>The youngsters must be fed.</i>

33
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:05,841
<i>I must feed them!</i>

34
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:09,386
What's that sweet smell?

35
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,096
Is it food?

36
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,599
No, it smells like flowers.

37
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:17,937
Where there are flowers,
there's usually water.

38
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,438
Track it down for us, Chil!

39
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:20,648
On it!

40
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:27,529
Is this place a graveyard or something?

41
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:32,159
Wait, someone's there.

42
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:39,625
Don't look!

43
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:44,046
W-We beg your pardon.

44
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,923
Hey, Senshi! Let go of me!

45
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,551
Get back, Senshi!

46
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,058
What's this?

47
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,059
Draw your weapon!

48
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:59,311
These creatures aren't human.

49
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:01,563
They're Dryad flowers!

50
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:04,024
Then what's this body fluid?

51
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:05,818
<i>It was not a liquid.</i>

52
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,321
<i>Tiny particles entered the body
through the respiratory system,</i>

53
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,948
<i>sticking to the mucous membrane.</i>

54
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:15,703
<i>The body recognized
these particles as poison</i>

55
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:20,624
<i>and kicked the immune system into gear,
immediately attempting to flush them out.</i>

56
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,084
<i>This is known as...</i>

57
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:26,463
<i>hay fever.</i>

58
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,590
Ugh, gross!

59
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:29,758
It hurts!

60
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,803
{\an8}It's the Dryads' pollen!

61
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:35,556
This is bad. Don't breathe it!

62
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,353
This isn't good.

63
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:43,230
I can't stop crying.

64
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:48,652
Get up!

65
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:50,154
Pull yourself together, Senshi!

66
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:52,239
Laios!

67
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:54,366
- Kensuke...
- Dammit!

68
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,368
My eyes are acting up too...

69
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:00,122
Senshi, reach out your hand!

70
00:05:00,706 --> 00:05:03,584
On three, use it to strike behind you!

71
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:05,002
One,

72
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:06,670
two...

73
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:08,589
Three!

74
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,931
Damn, my eyes are starting to itch too.

75
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,266
I can't see.

76
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:28,734
Run, Senshi!

77
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:29,651
No!

78
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:32,780
It is my duty to protect the youngsters!

79
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:34,156
Are you serious?

80
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,074
Chilchuck!

81
00:05:35,574 --> 00:05:37,284
Be my eyes!

82
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,620
I can't. I can't see anything!

83
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:41,955
You have sharper senses!

84
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,666
<i>Smell?</i>

85
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,170
<i>No, the smell of pollen
is too overpowering.</i>

86
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:49,588
<i>Hearing?</i>

87
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:52,800
<i>Senshi's sneezing too loud.</i>

88
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:56,053
<i>I can't rely on my sight,
smell, or hearing.</i>

89
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,014
<i>The wind!</i>

90
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:03,352
{\an8}It avoided your sneeze
and retreated diagonally to the right.

91
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:05,395
Senshi, swing up now!

92
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:14,863
Kensuke...

93
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:19,243
<i>My staff is completely broken in half.</i>

94
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:22,996
<i>I've got to mend it and infuse it
with magic quickly before it withers away.</i>

95
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,792
<i>It took me years to nurture it
to its current state...</i>

96
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:32,756
I-It's safe in there.

97
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,882
Don't lie!

98
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:37,511
You fought against Dryad flowers?

99
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,596
That must've been tough.

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,765
I didn't think they were flower monsters.

101
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,018
I totally thought they were
male and female humans.

102
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,146
Dryads are unisexual flowers,

103
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,106
so you're right about them
being male and female.

104
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:51,275
Just maybe...

105
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,901
{\an8}What will you do about him?

106
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,279
{\an8}Shouldn't we stop him by force?

107
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:59,366
{\an8}But we can't afford to be picky anymore.

108
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:03,662
{\an8}At this point, does it really matter
if the flower resembles a human?

109
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:05,080
Marci--

110
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:08,542
I found some!

111
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,878
Dryad fruits!

112
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,881
How to turn back time...

113
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:16,800
Stop hunting for shady magic
like it's no big deal!

114
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:20,220
Your black magic jokes aren't funny!

115
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:25,309
The last Dryad I took out
didn't release any pollen.

116
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,144
{\an8}It must've been a female flower.

117
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:31,482
{\an8}Flowers before pollination
care for and protect their fruits.

118
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:34,776
I found some more
fruit-like things over here.

119
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:37,779
Those are buds.

120
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:40,282
They'll eventually grow
into Dryad flowers.

121
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,785
These seem easier
to eat than those fruits.

122
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:45,829
They might be pretty tasty.

123
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:47,247
Let's harvest them.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,044
Don't pick too many.

125
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,255
Okay.

126
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:58,342
There are Mandrakes here.

127
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,302
We don't have time to get a dog,

128
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,262
so I'll just chop its head off
if you don't mind.

129
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:05,599
Shut up. When are you going
to let me live that down?

130
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:10,437
It's a pretty decent harvest.

131
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:13,565
Good thing I borrowed
an axe from the orcs!

132
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:19,613
<i>Put the chopped ingredients
into a pot with water and let it stew.</i>

133
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:22,866
<i>When the ingredients are soft,
remove from heat</i>

134
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,118
<i>and mash them inside the pot.</i>

135
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:30,374
<i>Once they turn into a paste,
add more water and seasoning.</i>

136
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,173
Smells delightful.

137
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:39,383
I have an idea.

138
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:43,470
<i>Sauté them lightly with butter
and throw in some mushrooms.</i>

139
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:47,391
<i>Pour melted cheese on top,</i>

140
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:48,642
<i>and it's done!</i>

141
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:51,395
JACK-O'-LANTERN POTAGE AND
SAUTÉED DRYAD BUDS WITH CHEESE

142
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:53,689
Did you have to put the soup in that?

143
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:56,900
I thought it might aid
in restoring your magic a little.

144
00:08:56,984 --> 00:09:00,279
Don't think you can excuse it
just because you meant well.

145
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:02,114
I'll try it, though.

146
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:04,491
<i>It's sweet!</i>

147
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:06,243
<i>It has a light floral fragrance.</i>

148
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,495
<i>It's rich and creamy,
but melts in your mouth.</i>

149
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:10,455
<i>I love this.</i>

150
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:13,125
What an appalling sight.

151
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:20,340
The sourness of the cheese
pairs nicely with this.

152
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:23,010
I like the bitter tang the buds have.

153
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:27,306
Anyway, how do we
even get out of this dungeon?

154
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:29,558
What if we never find our way out?

155
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:33,145
{\an8}If all the routes
to the surface are blocked,

156
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:36,023
{\an8}it would disrupt the flow of magic,
so that's unlikely.

157
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:38,650
There has to be a way out somewhere.

158
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:42,863
Are there any patterns
to the shifts in the dungeon?

159
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:44,197
There must be!

160
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,700
Let's note down the timings
and locations of the rumblings.

161
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:48,744
I'm starting to feel hopeful.

162
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:52,039
A full stomach does wonders
for optimism, doesn't it?

163
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,754
I'm starting to feel warmer.

164
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:01,089
I think some of my magic is returning.

165
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:04,426
Laios and Senshi,
I need to heal your injuries.

166
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,219
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

167
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:07,429
I won't.

168
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,891
Laios, you'll be the one doing the work.

169
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:14,227
I'll teach you some magic.

170
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:18,482
I can't protect all of you
from the lunatic magician by myself.

171
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:22,319
If you can use healing and defense magic,
it would help a lot.

172
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,364
Falin has taught you the basics, right?

173
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:26,865
Sort of.

174
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:29,618
She specializes in the gnome magic system,

175
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,871
{\an8}which is a bit different
from the one I use.

176
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:35,916
But the fundamentals are similar,
so you'll catch on.

177
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,251
{\an8}I'll drum it into you in no time.

178
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:43,006
We need to become stronger.

179
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,553
Those two are too optimistic.

180
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:51,932
When you're young, that's just right.

181
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:56,103
Would you stop treating me like a child?

182
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:57,521
It's embarrassing!

183
00:10:57,604 --> 00:11:00,774
{\an8}Why did you cover my eyes
in front of the monsters anyway?

184
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:02,442
It helped in hindsight, but still!

185
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,029
Well, Chilchuck...

186
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:09,616
You mentioned your father had passed away.

187
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:11,952
What about it?

188
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:12,911
I see.

189
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:17,082
This seems like a good opportunity,
so I'll teach you something.

190
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,835
Take a seat.

191
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,797
You're probably getting to that age
where you're starting to get curious,

192
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,217
but it's important
to have the correct information.

193
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,052
What's this about?

194
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:30,762
You see, humans

195
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:32,681
also have stamens and pistils.

196
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:36,059
That's not it! Again!

197
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:37,811
Pay attention!

198
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:42,357
<i>And so, they passed the night away.</i>

199
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:46,278
Come on. Hurry.

200
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:53,660
Not like that!

201
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,456
I didn't want to touch you in a weird way.

202
00:11:57,539 --> 00:11:59,541
Don't let stuff like that bother you!

203
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,251
{\an8}Give me your left hand.

204
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,922
See? Just like this.

205
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:10,010
Feeling embarrassed won't help you
improve your magic skills.

206
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:11,803
Now focus!

207
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:16,224
Be mindful of the magic
coursing through your body,

208
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:17,851
like blood through your veins.

209
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,312
Let it flow through
the palms of your hands,

210
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:24,524
from the top of your head
to the tips of my toes.

211
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:28,403
Sync your breathing,
temperature, and pulse with mine.

212
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:32,449
Once you're ready, repeat after me.

213
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,576
{\an8}<i>-Sperae...
- Sperae...</i>

214
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:36,578
{\an8}<i>-Yeptum...
- Yeptum...</i>

215
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:38,705
{\an8}<i>-Rufermus...
- Rufermus...</i>

216
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,165
{\an8}<i>-Vilal...
- Vilal...</i>

217
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:42,417
<i>- Eurekant...
- Eurekant...</i>

218
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:44,419
<i>- Oonzu...
- Oonzu...</i>

219
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:46,171
That's itchy!

220
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:49,633
It's itching like crazy!

221
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:50,884
A-Are you okay?

222
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,553
My scab came off.

223
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:55,972
It worked!

224
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:57,140
You did it, Laios!

225
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:58,350
{\an8}Really?

226
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,227
{\an8}You're bleeding, though.

227
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,479
This is normal for your first try.

228
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,606
But you're a fast learner.

229
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:07,067
Maybe you really do
come from a talented line!

230
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,737
The way you explained things
made it easy to understand.

231
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,489
Thanks.

232
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,992
Well then, before you forget this feeling,

233
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:17,410
let's try healing Senshi.

234
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,706
I'll be watching,
so repeat what you did just now.

235
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,752
<i>Now, it's a temporary fix,</i>

236
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:27,629
<i>but I'll use Dryad twigs
to repair my staff.</i>

237
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:29,047
<i>I hope it attaches.</i>

238
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:35,554
- That felt weird.
- S-Sorry!

239
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,639
Like I said,
don't let stuff like that bother you!

240
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:39,641
Don't be embarrassed.

241
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:42,018
Feeling shy
is the biggest obstacle to progress!

242
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,480
Actually, you shouldn't
underestimate things like that.

243
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:49,901
Healers interact a lot with people,
which can cause difficulties.

244
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:53,530
The main reason parties break up
is often due to relationship issues.

245
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:56,908
Falling in and out of love,
envy, jealousy,

246
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:58,410
grudges and hatred.

247
00:13:58,493 --> 00:14:00,078
They can be a real hassle.

248
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:03,832
Are you talking about Falin and Shuro?

249
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:05,875
I'm just speaking from my own experiences.

250
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,297
A leader needs the ability
to unite people more than combat skills.

251
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:13,925
To be honest, I want Laios
to focus on developing his social skills

252
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,177
and his ability to read people
more than magic.

253
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:20,098
If he had done so, he wouldn't have
unknowingly ended up

254
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:21,641
being an accomplice in black magic.

255
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:26,146
Well, Chilchuck, why don't you
learn a bit about magic yourself?

256
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:28,023
Maybe your ignorance is making you afraid.

257
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:30,025
Well, sorry about that!

258
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:33,778
Many of my kin got kidnapped by elves
and never came back,

259
00:14:33,862 --> 00:14:36,823
just because they were involved
with some black magic artifact.

260
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:39,451
That's why I never got the chance
to learn more about magic.

261
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:41,119
So forgive me if I'm ignorant.

262
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:44,831
To sum up the ancient magic I'm studying,

263
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:49,210
it draws energy from another dimension
where infinity exists.

264
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:52,756
<i>How do you turn a cup of water into vapor?</i>

265
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,549
<i>By bringing it to a boil.</i>

266
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,970
<i>Well then, how do you
vaporize an entire lake?</i>

267
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:00,805
The theory is the same,

268
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:02,849
but actually doing it is a bit tricky.

269
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:07,604
<i>This magic would require
an enormous amount of power and time.</i>

270
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,356
<i>So, you reinforce it
with coordinate magic.</i>

271
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:13,151
This dungeon is connected
to the other dimension at multiple points.

272
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:17,572
It's through this power that monsters
are summoned and this dungeon is formed.

273
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:22,702
{\an8}Earlier, Falin no longer
had the strength to revive herself.

274
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:26,623
<i>So I rewrote a section of the dungeon</i>

275
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:30,126
<i>to make her body a part of the dungeon.</i>

276
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:32,379
Only for a brief moment, of course.

277
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:36,257
Another rumbling.

278
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:37,258
It's close.

279
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,011
Look over there!

280
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:41,346
The wall is crumbling.

281
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:44,265
Where are the bricks going?

282
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:46,059
How about we take a closer look?

283
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,145
Huh?

284
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:51,690
What's wrong?

285
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,650
I-I suddenly feel dizzy.

286
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:59,406
You might be experiencing mana sickness
because you used magic for the first time.

287
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,908
It should pass soon.

288
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,034
We're leaving you behind.

289
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:04,494
Stay put, okay?

290
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:09,165
<i>Whether my eyes are shut or open,
all I see are lurid colors.</i>

291
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,501
<i>Help.</i>

292
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,253
<i>Let me die.</i>

293
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:14,921
<i>The magician...</i>

294
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:18,341
<i>Am I hallucinating? Am I hearing things?</i>

295
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,636
<i>Please, let me die.</i>

296
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,889
<i>Mana sickness sucks.</i>

297
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:30,395
The path is shifting.

298
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,025
It feels like we're starting to grasp
a pattern, but then again, not quite.

299
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:39,029
We'll need to observe for a little longer.

300
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:41,865
It's frustrating that we can't
make much progress, but...

301
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:45,618
The platform is rising!

302
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:46,911
Get off!

303
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:48,413
Ow!

304
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:50,040
{\an8}That was close.

305
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:52,667
We almost lost our way back.

306
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:58,506
<i>Carrier of a cruel, petrifying venom,</i>

307
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,841
<i>the Cockatrice.</i>

308
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:06,014
It's like a Basilisk!

309
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:08,266
But a Cockatrice is much worse!

310
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,601
Never let it bite you!

311
00:17:09,684 --> 00:17:11,019
You'll be turned to stone!

312
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:13,188
There's a door on the left!

313
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:14,731
Let's get in there!

314
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:28,620
What's our plan now?

315
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:30,455
This door won't hold for very long.

316
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:32,624
Can we sneak out through the back?

317
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:36,086
If this thing is anything like a Basilisk,

318
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:39,047
it should sense us by our body heat.

319
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:41,758
It will be tricky to give it the slip.

320
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:45,386
But that's the ability of the serpent.

321
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,181
The rooster head
should rely on its vision.

322
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:53,269
Marcille, do you remember how
Laios took down the Basilisk last time?

323
00:17:57,148 --> 00:17:59,442
<i>Don't let it frighten you!</i>

324
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:02,487
<i>Intimidate the Cockatrice
with all your heart and soul!</i>

325
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:05,573
<i>Easier said than done.</i>

326
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:10,078
<i>Make yourself look big
and shout at the top of your lungs!</i>

327
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:13,456
<i>Sure, I might be the tallest of the three,</i>

328
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,334
<i>but that Cockatrice
is twice as big as the Basilisk.</i>

329
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:19,712
<i>And I'm not confident
about shouting either.</i>

330
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:22,549
<i>Wait, how did Laios shout again?</i>

331
00:18:23,383 --> 00:18:25,593
<i>Was it like a yell?</i>

332
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:27,345
<i>Or more like a roar?</i>

333
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:34,269
<i>Never mind. If I can frighten it,
that's all that matters!</i>

334
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,151
<i>The end.</i>

335
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:42,610
<i>This won't work.</i>

336
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,696
<i>I just know I'll fail!</i>

337
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,573
<i>There's no way I can do what Laios did.</i>

338
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:48,616
<i>So what do I do?</i>

339
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:52,662
<i>I'll have to do it</i>

340
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:54,831
<i>my own way!</i>

341
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:01,254
<i>The most brilliant female student
in the school's history,</i>

342
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:02,589
<i>Marcille!</i>

343
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,926
What was that explosion just now?

344
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,720
It's Marcille! Let's go!

345
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,644
Too shallow.

346
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:20,648
<i>Oh no. I drew too much
attention to myself.</i>

347
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:22,817
<i>Now both heads are focused on me.</i>

348
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,153
<i>I don't have time
to finish an incantation.</i>

349
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:38,166
Marcille! Did it bite you?

350
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:39,959
I'm okay.

351
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:43,880
It bit you, you idiot!

352
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:45,548
For crying out loud!

353
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:48,051
What? You got bitten by a Cockatrice?

354
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:49,260
This is bad.

355
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:52,138
Do you know what to do
when you're bitten by a Cockatrice?

356
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,182
There's a procedure for that?

357
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:56,017
First, take off your pants.

358
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:59,979
Sit with your legs tightly closed.

359
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:04,192
Keep your arms to your sides
and cover your ears with your hands.

360
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:05,568
Close your mouth too.

361
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:09,822
Perfect.

362
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:12,116
Now you're all set
to turn into stone at any moment.

363
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,827
I thought the procedure
was supposed to prevent that!

364
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:23,294
She got petrified
in an awfully precarious position.

365
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:24,379
Something might break.

366
00:20:24,462 --> 00:20:27,465
Her center of gravity is off,
so she might topple any second.

367
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:29,175
This is bad.

368
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:32,637
Being turned to stone
is the last thing a human could want.

369
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,472
What are we going to do?

370
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:35,974
Is there a way to reverse it?

371
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:38,476
There are a couple of ways.

372
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,728
First, we could wait
for her to heal naturally.

373
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:44,482
Apparently, petrification is more
of a curse than the effects of a poison.

374
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,193
Elves have strong resistance to spells,

375
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:49,320
so she should recover faster
compared to other races.

376
00:20:49,821 --> 00:20:54,158
Next, we can try finding
other adventurers who might have herbs

377
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:56,619
or know-how to reverse petrification.

378
00:20:57,203 --> 00:21:01,124
{\an8}Lastly, I could give it a shot
with a healing spell.

379
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:02,542
You?

380
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,628
Marcille taught me how
to read the book of magic.

381
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:08,631
There should be a spell in there
to reverse petrification.

382
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,885
Let's keep an eye out
for herbs and other adventurers,

383
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,430
while also giving
the other two options a try.

384
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,641
How long will it take for her to heal?

385
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:21,853
It takes anywhere from six months
to ten years for a tall-man.

386
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,355
I'll go fetch the Cockatrice.

387
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,736
<i>They got pretty discolored in one night.</i>

388
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:31,738
<i>I need to process them quickly.</i>

389
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:34,365
She looks like she's about to fall over.

390
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:37,660
Shouldn't we put something under her?

391
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:39,037
You're right.

392
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,872
I've got a good idea.

393
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:46,169
<i>Mix the julienned buds with seasoning
and place them in a pot.</i>

394
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:48,129
<i>Then, put Marcille on top.</i>

395
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:50,923
Oops, her eyelashes broke off.

396
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:53,760
<i>Soak the Cockatrice meat in salt water,</i>

397
00:21:53,843 --> 00:21:57,388
<i>place it on Marcille's lap,
and let it rest.</i>

398
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,268
I suppose her position is more stable now.

399
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,270
She shouldn't topple over anymore.

400
00:22:04,854 --> 00:22:06,898
She looks like some idol
from a pagan religion.

401
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:10,485
<i>After that, Laios
and his team worked hard.</i>

402
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:11,402
DAY 2

403
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:13,321
<i>They continued with trial and error.</i>

404
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:14,238
DAY 3

405
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:17,033
<i>And on the fourth day...</i>

406
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:18,034
{\an8}Found one!

407
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:20,036
How do you use it?

408
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:23,414
Why don't we try

409
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,041
placing it on her?

410
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,127
<i>The stone is starting
to warm with my body heat.</i>

411
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:29,796
<i>Let's try the spell.</i>

412
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,298
<i>Sperae Yeptum</i>

413
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,801
<i>Rufermus Vilal...</i>

414
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,888
<i>Am I pronouncing it correctly?</i>

415
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:41,891
Watch out!

416
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:49,690
Marcille!

417
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:50,817
You're soft again.

418
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,652
It worked!

419
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:53,861
Huh?

420
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:54,904
What's going on?

421
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:56,906
Why do I have vegetable slices on me?

422
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:58,366
And what's with this pot?

423
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,201
Let's see.

424
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:02,787
This worked too.

425
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,122
- Hurray!
- Will someone explain?

426
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:06,874
<i>Boil the brined meat</i>

427
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,626
<i>and cut it into thin slices.</i>

428
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:11,879
<i>Dress it with fermented buds,</i>

429
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:13,506
<i>and it's done.</i>

430
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,860
EISBEIN-STYLE COCKATRICE
AND SAUERKRAUT-STYLE DRYAD BUDS

431
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,635
It's been that long?

432
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:20,096
In the end, what did the trick?

433
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:23,099
We tried so many things,
who can say for sure?

434
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:25,351
I hope it was my spell.

435
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:28,646
Nah, I say it was
the fresh herbs that did it.

436
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:33,651
Maybe the cooked Cockatrice meat
neutralized the curse.

437
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:37,196
{\an8}<i>We need to get back
to the surface as soon as possible,</i>

438
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,698
{\an8}<i>and yet I delayed us all.</i>

439
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,408
{\an8}You guys, I'm sor--

440
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:43,119
{\an8}<i>No, that's not it.</i>

441
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:46,789
{\an8}<i>There's something else
I should say in this situation.</i>

442
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:49,333
{\an8}<i>Yes, first, I should say...</i>

443
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,212
You shouldn't use someone
as a fermentation weight.

444
00:23:54,088 --> 00:23:56,340
<i>Be that as it may, dungeon food.</i>

445
00:23:56,424 --> 00:23:58,634
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>
