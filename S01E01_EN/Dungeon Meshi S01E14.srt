1
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:23,856
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,843
<i>Laios and his crew agreed
to head back to the surface.</i>

3
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,886
<i>I don't want to lose you guys!</i>

4
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,596
<i>You guys...</i>

5
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,975
<i>The strength of their bonds
was reaffirmed.</i>

6
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,477
<i>A little earlier...</i>

7
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,356
Are you awake now?

8
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,608
Do you feel any discomfort?

9
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:52,611
You seem well enough.

10
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,573
You were low on blood,
so I used some goat blood.

11
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:56,824
But it's not ideal.

12
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,702
You should head back to town.

13
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:03,831
If you had stayed dead on the water,
you'd be fish bait by now.

14
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:06,834
You should thank whoever pulled you out.

15
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,878
Do you think it was...

16
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,129
Kuro!

17
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:15,384
I recognize these scents.

18
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:20,890
An elf, a tall-man,
a half-foot, and a dwarf.

19
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,683
The same folks who took our treasure.

20
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,476
I suspected it was them!

21
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,857
I require a revival fee.

22
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,735
I'll only charge you for the goat.

23
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,280
Right, I remember now.

24
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,782
We were attacked by Fish-men and...

25
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,374
So, we died again.

26
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,002
This will do.

27
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,087
<i>Are they adventurers?</i>

28
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,592
Are you...

29
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,510
What?

30
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,763
Nothing.

31
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,806
Let's go, Namari.

32
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,058
Yeah, coming.

33
00:03:07,436 --> 00:03:09,271
You're even making eyes at a dwarf?

34
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,482
You have no standards.

35
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:16,028
Well, I've never picked my friends
based on how tall they are.

36
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:16,946
Is that so?

37
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,698
Our provisions are gone!

38
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,951
They must've stolen from us again!

39
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:22,868
Food.

40
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,244
How dare they!

41
00:03:24,828 --> 00:03:25,788
Not again.

42
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,916
They've taken our food but left our money?

43
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,252
Maybe they've depleted their own supplies.

44
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,711
Infuriating.

45
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,797
We need to take them to task.

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,257
What do we do, Kabru?

47
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,551
We've got no other option.

48
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:40,678
Let's head back to town.

49
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:42,513
What? Seriously?

50
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,098
Without catching the thieves?

51
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,935
We're out of provisions,
so we can't push on.

52
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:50,145
Let's admit our own lack of skills.

53
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,815
Just like those people said,

54
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:55,150
we should be thankful
we're still breathing.

55
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,531
If that's your call, Kabru, I'm with you.

56
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:01,657
Same here.

57
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,244
If you promise you won't forget
about finding those thieves,

58
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,662
I'll follow your lead.

59
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:08,914
You have my word, Rin.

60
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,125
Kuro will follow Mickbell.

61
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,881
{\an8}We're going to be deep in the red
after this expedition.

62
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:27,391
It's getting foggy.

63
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,893
Everyone, watch out--

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,318
<i>This isn't a natural fog.</i>

65
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,320
<i>Could a monster be causing this?</i>

66
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,828
<i>A Fish-man?</i>

67
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,206
<i>Where did they come from?</i>

68
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,460
<i>Dammit. I'll have to fight.</i>

69
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:56,962
<i>Here it comes!</i>

70
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:06,305
<i>The way it wields its axe
like it's mowing something down...</i>

71
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:09,933
<i>I know it very well.</i>

72
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,102
<i>Yes.</i>

73
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,604
<i>It's...</i>

74
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,027
Shh!

75
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,654
It's okay. Calm down.

76
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,740
Daya, it's me.

77
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,745
<i>This fog is illusion magic.</i>

78
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:33,791
<i>The confused one
with the drawn weapon has to be Kuro.</i>

79
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,627
<i>And the one standing in a daze is Holm.</i>

80
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,630
<i>He tends to freeze
when too much happens all at once.</i>

81
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,591
<i>And the one who bolted earlier
must be Mick.</i>

82
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:46,178
<i>In that case, the biggest threat here is...</i>

83
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:48,555
<i>Rin.</i>

84
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,808
<i>Just as I feared,
she's chanting something.</i>

85
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:54,311
<i>She has the power
to reduce us all to cinders.</i>

86
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,190
<i>The only way to peacefully
interrupt a mage's incantation is...</i>

87
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:05,572
{\an8}Rinsha.

88
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:08,367
Do you see? This is an illusion.

89
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,079
<i>It's a shame she's
in the form of a monster.</i>

90
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,583
<i>Now then, how do we
dispel this illusionary fog?</i>

91
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:29,012
<i>It's not this one.</i>

92
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,849
<i>A spellcaster wouldn't
come charging with a weapon.</i>

93
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,602
<i>They'd observe from a distance.</i>

94
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,020
<i>That one!</i>

95
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,147
What?

96
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,869
You got us.

97
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:52,870
We surrender.

98
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,081
Let him go, will you?

99
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,292
These guys...

100
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,378
<i>They are the corpse retrievers
we ran into on the upper floor!</i>

101
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,173
This isn't a chance reunion, is it?

102
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,924
You were following us, right?

103
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,051
What do you mean?

104
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:11,263
Retrieving bodies
in the lower levels pays better,

105
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:13,182
thanks to Island subsidies.

106
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,020
<i>We were intent
on getting our stolen loot back</i>

107
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,397
<i>and entered a level we weren't ready for.</i>

108
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:23,150
All they had to do
was leisurely follow our trail

109
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,444
for more lucrative corpses.

110
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:26,904
Oh.

111
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,322
Infuriating.

112
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,990
But you guys were a little too slow.

113
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,368
<i>By the time you found us,
we were already resurrected</i>

114
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,496
<i>and on our way back to the surface.</i>

115
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,624
<i>You got antsy
and resorted to extreme measures.</i>

116
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,918
<i>You used magic
to make us turn on each other.</i>

117
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:42,794
Close, but not quite.

118
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:45,797
Actually, it would've been ideal
if you caught up with your thieves

119
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,592
and fought with them
and killed each other.

120
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,552
But what a letdown.

121
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,306
We didn't think you'd get taken out
by monsters so quickly.

122
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,433
You...!

123
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,354
Stealing from and attacking
fellow adventurers is a serious offense.

124
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:02,397
I'll be reporting this
to the Lord of the Island.

125
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,068
How about we make a deal?

126
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,862
Going back empty-handed
would be a loss for you.

127
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,741
Two of our comrades
are lying dead over there.

128
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,619
Take them to the resurrection office.

129
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:18,163
You should be able to make a tidy sum.

130
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:20,832
They're only unconscious.

131
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:25,921
I'll testify that they
were attacked by Fish-men.

132
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,048
Our share would be...

133
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,925
Let's see, 40...

134
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:32,553
No, 30% will do.

135
00:08:33,053 --> 00:08:33,971
What do you say?

136
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:35,806
It's not a bad deal for you.

137
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,227
Fine. Deal.

138
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,438
Kabru...

139
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:56,702
You bastard!

140
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,745
I'm not surprised.

141
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,955
That's our Kabru!

142
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,344
Humans really are easy to kill.

143
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:19,308
Tall-man, dwarf, gnome,
they all share the same weak points.

144
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,518
Even their movements are similar.

145
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,146
If only monsters were the same,
it'd make things simpler.

146
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,608
Kuro, could you go find Mick?

147
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:28,692
Woof!

148
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:29,776
Kabru.

149
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,361
What do we do with him?

150
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,739
P-Please let me go.

151
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:35,532
I didn't know anything!

152
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,369
You don't care about
breaking the curse on the dungeon

153
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,788
or exterminating monsters.

154
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,543
More and more people are making
a quick buck by robbing others.

155
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,921
At this rate, decent people
will leave the Island.

156
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:55,677
That's why
I can't forgive people like you.

157
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,429
Please don't.

158
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,615
Kabru.

159
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,077
Sorry about what I did earlier.

160
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,745
It was the only thing I could think of.

161
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,123
What are you talking about?

162
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,958
I don't know and I don't care to know.

163
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,210
That's a relief.

164
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,547
I'm growing impatient,
and we're not making much progress.

165
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:34,007
You're right.

166
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,218
And this is where our impatience led us.

167
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,844
It sucks.

168
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,347
Can't you offer some encouragement
once in a while?

169
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,641
There's no use sugarcoating it.

170
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:44,851
This is the reality of our abilities.

171
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:49,981
The Lord of the Island only sees
the dungeon as a profitable pit.

172
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,067
Even if it runs out of treasure,

173
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,778
he believes he can get by
on monster hides and bones.

174
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:59,157
But the truth is, no one will enter
the dungeon once it's fully explored.

175
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:02,244
Either because
there's no fortune to be made

176
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:04,830
or because it doesn't excite
the adventurous spirit.

177
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,458
Fewer and fewer people will be here.

178
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,962
<i>Monsters will spill out
from the dungeon and attack citizens.</i>

179
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,341
That's how many settlements
have fallen into ruin.

180
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:19,678
We must lift the curse
on the dungeon quickly.

181
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,514
There's no room for monsters
or dungeons in this world.

182
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,057
Yeah.

183
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:27,644
I'm hungry.

184
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,605
Being resurrected
makes you hungry, doesn't it?

185
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,524
Kabru!

186
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,652
{\an8}Those guys had
quite a bit of valuables on them!

187
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:36,945
All right.

188
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,739
Take their food,
but toss the rest into the lake.

189
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,741
What? Are you serious?

190
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:46,329
If we took their valuables,
we'd be no better than them.

191
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,624
Once that's done, let's have a light meal.

192
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,626
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

193
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:53,962
ADVENTURERS' RATIONS
SALTED MEAT

194
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:56,047
BREAD, WINE, NUTS AND DRIED FRUITS

195
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:58,049
- Let's dig in!
- Let's dig in!

196
00:11:58,967 --> 00:11:59,801
Yum!

197
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,845
They're eating pretty well.

198
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:04,055
Corpse retrievers
make a pretty penny, huh?

199
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,225
Especially if they're the ones creating
the corpses and bringing them back.

200
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,686
But won't the Lord of the Island catch on?

201
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,190
There's a screening process
to claim rewards from the Island.

202
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:16,443
They must've been pretty clever
to slip through that.

203
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:22,532
Or maybe they're in cahoots
with more parties than we realize.

204
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,951
That's so rotten.

205
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,454
In the end, they're just
digging their own grave.

206
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:29,206
Will you inform the Lord of the Island?

207
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:32,709
I doubt that Lord will come up
with a good solution.

208
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:36,087
Newbies like Doni will end up
getting the short end of the stick.

209
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:39,841
If only that stupid Lord
gains so much weight that he pops.

210
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,094
Then the elves will come swooping in.

211
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:46,348
We still need him
to hold out as a bulwark.

212
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:52,354
Anyway, a tall-man, a dwarf,
a half-foot, and an elf, huh?

213
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:53,605
What's this about?

214
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:57,108
The party that cast
a ghost-warding spell on us.

215
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,236
You mean those treasure thieves.

216
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:01,029
Food robbers.

217
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,907
There aren't many parties with an elf.

218
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,117
We could identify them
with some narrowing down.

219
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,620
Do you think it's Doni and Fionil?

220
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:12,207
It's hard to imagine them
venturing down to the third floor.

221
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,585
And I find it odd
that they're only a party of four.

222
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,629
It's rather reckless of them.

223
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:19,798
Rin, Holm.

224
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:22,133
Do you notice anything
about this ghost-warding spell?

225
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:23,927
You still have it on?

226
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,887
I mean, it's evidence.

227
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,390
I'm not familiar with spells like that.

228
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,892
Let me take a look.

229
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,314
It screams "honor student."

230
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,942
It looks like it's
straight out of a textbook.

231
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:41,152
And whoever did it wasn't used to it.

232
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,530
They might even be
a magic school graduate.

233
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:46,825
All graduates produce similar spells.

234
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,703
And there's no doubt
it's the work of an elf.

235
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,414
Magic school...

236
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,418
Hmm, magic school, huh?

237
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,711
Interesting.

238
00:13:57,794 --> 00:13:58,920
What? What is it?

239
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,132
Well, I have a hunch
about whose party this might be.

240
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,676
It's just a guess, but

241
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,970
I'd be thrilled if I'm right.

242
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:09,889
Out with it. Cut the drama.

243
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,182
Well,

244
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,518
{\an8}I think it's the party
with the Touden siblings.

245
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,854
Touden? You mean those two?

246
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,773
They don't strike me as the criminal type.

247
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:19,941
What's your reasoning?

248
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:24,946
First, if I remember correctly,
the sister is a magic school graduate.

249
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,908
But the one who cast
the ghost-warding spell was an elf.

250
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,743
And those siblings are tall-men.

251
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:32,329
Hold on, let me finish.

252
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:36,333
<i>The elf in their party
seemed pretty close to the sister,</i>

253
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,419
<i>as if they were childhood friends.</i>

254
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,423
<i>So I figured they must've attended
the same magic school.</i>

255
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:47,218
Magic school graduates
are rare around here,

256
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,845
especially if they're an elf.

257
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,182
I suppose it's possible.

258
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:53,892
But it's not enough to go on.

259
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:57,312
Plus, Kuro only smelled one tall-man.

260
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:59,230
If they're siblings,
he should've smelled two.

261
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,485
{\an8}Are you suggesting that's why
they're venturing with a small group?

262
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:06,404
{\an8}Exactly! One of the siblings got lost,

263
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,741
{\an8}and there was a disagreement in the party
about whether to rescue them.

264
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:13,745
I think so because we just crossed paths
with a former member of their group.

265
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:17,791
<i>They had disputes over their goals
and income even before this.</i>

266
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:21,419
<i>And maybe this incident
led some of them to leave.</i>

267
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,089
<i>Now desperate, they're resorting
to stealing treasure and food.</i>

268
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,509
- You're starting to convince me.
- Right?

269
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:31,888
But Kuro, you mentioned
catching a whiff of a dwarf too.

270
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,015
I did. Strong dwarf scent.

271
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,433
That's odd then.

272
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,435
Why would they still
have a dwarf with them?

273
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,688
Maybe they recruited another one.

274
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,774
Who else is in their party?

275
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:43,775
Let's see.

276
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,194
<i>The tall-men are Laios, Falin,</i>

277
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:48,905
<i>and probably Shuro, an Easterner.</i>

278
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,032
<i>There's Namari, the dwarf we saw earlier,</i>

279
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,200
<i>and Marcille the elf.</i>

280
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,870
<i>I think the half-foot's name
was Chilchuck or something.</i>

281
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:58,832
<i>Assuming this is
the Touden siblings' party,</i>

282
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:02,168
<i>one of their siblings,
as well as Shuro and Namari, departed.</i>

283
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,587
<i>And another dwarf joined them, I think.</i>

284
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,800
I see. So the woman back there was Namari.

285
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:12,095
Do you know anything about her, Daya?

286
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:13,471
Only her name.

287
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,597
She's pretty well-known.

288
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:17,225
She's the only daughter of a guy
known as the "Arms Dealer."

289
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:18,601
"Arms Dealer"?

290
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:21,688
He used to control
the arms trade on this Island.

291
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:26,109
<i>But one day, he was found
embezzling a hefty sum and vanished.</i>

292
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:28,111
<i>They say he's one of the reasons</i>

293
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,447
<i>the Lord of the Island
has a negative view of dwarves now.</i>

294
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,658
A lot of dwarves suffered because of him.

295
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:35,452
Including me.

296
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,706
No honorable dwarf
would want to follow in his footsteps.

297
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,958
{\an8}So maybe she's not an honorable dwarf.

298
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,878
{\an8}The scent I caught was intense.

299
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,922
{\an8}I know something about this Chilchuck guy.

300
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,716
{\an8}He's a middle-aged fellow,

301
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,094
{\an8}but he acts like he's the representative
for all the half-foots on this Island.

302
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:57,057
<i>He's a greedy guy who insists
on making contracts through the guild</i>

303
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,101
<i>and paying broker fees.</i>

304
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:03,480
I want no part of that,
so I'm steering clear.

305
00:17:03,563 --> 00:17:07,609
I mean, if he found out I hired a Kobold,
I'd get an earful for sure.

306
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,235
You wouldn't want that, right?

307
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,488
You want me to keep hiring you, don't you?

308
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,031
Mick gives me food.

309
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:14,240
Mick is a good boss.

310
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:18,912
I bet he's working him hard
for measly wages.

311
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:21,998
Holm, you shouldn't
make assumptions like that.

312
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,752
{\an8}Anyway, Rin, the Eastern tall-man
is from your neck of the woods.

313
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:27,462
Maybe you know each other.

314
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:28,505
Oh, please.

315
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,840
Don't group us together
just because we're both Easterners.

316
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,802
Depending on the region,
we don't even speak the same language.

317
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:36,596
And Shuro isn't a name from my island.

318
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,516
I might have more information on him then.

319
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,769
<i>He was a bit of a loner
even in Touden's crew.</i>

320
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,230
<i>He came to the Island
with a few other Easterners,</i>

321
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:47,774
<i>then joined Touden's party alone.</i>

322
00:17:47,857 --> 00:17:50,318
<i>He gave off this vibe
that he wasn't your average person,</i>

323
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:53,279
<i>and it seemed like he was venturing
into the dungeon to test his skills.</i>

324
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,157
But he left the party, huh?

325
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,536
He didn't strike me as someone
concerned about rewards or dangers.

326
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:03,623
Could it be that both siblings left,
and he's still in the party?

327
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:04,916
Nah, that's unlikely.

328
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:08,586
Kabru, you remember details about people
to the point where it's creepy.

329
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,171
Why do you sound so excited?

330
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,674
Because it's fun. It's really exciting!

331
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,554
There are countless people on this Island,
each with their own motives.

332
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:20,807
But when their entirely
different actions intersect,

333
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,227
it sparks a historic event
involving a whole lot of people.

334
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,354
I thought this was just
a boring case of theft,

335
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:28,940
but I sense something interesting
is about to happen.

336
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:31,901
I hope this crew
is the Touden siblings' party.

337
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,696
Because for a long time now,

338
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:37,949
I've been itching
to see their true colors revealed.

339
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:40,201
{\an8}Do you have a grudge
against them or something?

340
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,203
It's not like they've wronged me.

341
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,915
<i>In the past, Laios apparently
made a fortune in a gold-peeling crew.</i>

342
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,001
<i>But he was sharing most of his earnings</i>

343
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:51,212
<i>with comrades who couldn't enter
the dungeon due to illness or injury.</i>

344
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,214
{\an8}That's noble of him.

345
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,049
Yes, it's a touching story.

346
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,218
But there's more to it.

347
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:01,222
<i>His comrades had long recovered,
but kept taking the money.</i>

348
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,225
<i>In the end,
they never returned to adventuring</i>

349
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,978
<i>and now peddle
smuggled goods on the Island.</i>

350
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:10,398
"I shall bestow everything to whoever
defeats the lord of the dungeon."

351
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:13,818
That's what some king-like figure
of this country supposedly said.

352
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,947
{\an8}Regardless of whether you could
truly obtain everything or not,

353
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,618
{\an8}this dungeon itself
is a legacy left by ancient elves.

354
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:24,495
{\an8}I'm sure it holds significant power.

355
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:29,042
That's why I don't think it should
fall into the hands of those siblings.

356
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,502
<i>They're not saints.</i>

357
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,296
<i>They're just indifferent to people.</i>

358
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,798
<i>Just like the Lord of the Island.</i>

359
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,343
We know, Kabru.

360
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:40,762
We believe you're the only one.

361
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:43,264
The only one to drive out
that stupid Lord as well.

362
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,267
{\an8}But if you're still struggling
with monsters in this area,

363
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,519
{\an8}you've got a long road ahead of you.

364
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,313
You're right.

365
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,440
Well then, shall we get going soon?

366
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:55,235
May we make it back without any issues.

367
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,991
Whoa! That was close!

368
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:02,909
Blade Fish!

369
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,620
Don't let them distract you!

370
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,413
Watch your step!

371
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,878
<i>A Kraken? No, it's a Sea Serpent!</i>

372
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,129
Rin! Get back!

373
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:16,297
Incant--

374
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:18,299
Holm!

375
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,760
I can't summon her in this situation!

376
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:22,512
There's no telling
what might get mixed in!

377
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:28,017
<i>Don't panic.</i>

378
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,103
<i>It's up to you to do something, Kabru.</i>

379
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:33,022
<i>It's not a creature
that makes complicated movements.</i>

380
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,401
<i>Observe its motions,
and aim for its carotid artery.</i>

381
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:39,320
<i>Wait, where's its carotid artery?</i>

382
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,280
Excuse me.

383
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:44,158
Tade!

384
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,326
On it!

385
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:51,499
Young Master, it's in your court!

386
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,549
Young Master!

387
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,176
That was impressive.

388
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:04,262
Is your armor damaged?

389
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:05,179
No.

390
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:06,389
You must be weary.

391
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,474
How about something to eat?

392
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,310
No. Let's press forward.

393
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,313
What are we going to do
with the Young Master?

394
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:16,607
He's completely besotted
with that Northern girl.

395
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,569
Tade is hungry.

396
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:21,904
Kabru, are you hurt?

397
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:23,239
Change of plans.

398
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,492
It might be tasty stewed with daikon!

399
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,202
- That's dumb.
- Excuse me.

400
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:31,956
You saved me back there. Thank you.

401
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,291
I'm Kabru.

402
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:35,168
May I ask your names?

403
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:36,461
Don't mention it.

404
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:38,212
We were just passing through.

405
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,965
If I'm not mistaken,

406
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,468
you're searching for a woman.

407
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,596
D-Do you know something?

408
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:50,183
Just as I thought. My deepest sympathies.

409
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:53,102
I might be able to assist you

410
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,189
in your search for Falin Touden.

411
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,441
Stop it, Kuro!

412
00:21:58,524 --> 00:22:00,860
Didn't I tell you
not to make that expression?

413
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:02,028
It's frightening!

414
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,405
What's gotten into you?

415
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,199
<i>And so, Kabru and his crew</i>

416
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:08,951
<i>decided to venture deeper
into the dungeon once again.</i>

417
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:10,036
NOW

418
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,497
<i>Turning back time to Laios and his party,</i>

419
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,999
<i>two full days have passed
since they agreed to head back.</i>

420
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,460
It's a dead end.

421
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,462
Another dead end.

422
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:22,924
I'm famished.

423
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,383
I'm exhausted.

424
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:25,468
I'm parched.

425
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:28,846
<i>They were lost and on the brink of death.</i>
