1
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,862
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,877
Hey, are you sure we're on the right path?

3
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:43,921
Yup, these are the stairs we need to take.

4
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:46,549
After these steps,
we'll reach the fifth basement floor,

5
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:48,634
close to the orc settlement.

6
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:50,261
At least that's what it says on the map.

7
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,598
How are we supposed
to go down these steps?

8
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,934
This is incredible.

9
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,520
There's a wide variety
of Tentacles growing here.

10
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:02,273
The orcs totally made a fool of us.

11
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:04,358
They kindly laid a trap for us.

12
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:05,526
I'm not so sure.

13
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,528
This route leads to their settlement.

14
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:11,282
It's ideal for keeping away
outsiders at least.

15
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,909
Let's try moving forward.

16
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:18,789
Given the time and effort that would take,
taking a detour might be a quicker option.

17
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,420
Marcille, don't get
too close to the walls.

18
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:28,174
These creatures lurk within the walls.

19
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:32,303
<i>Places teeming with Tentacles
have just as many cavities.</i>

20
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:34,930
<i>It also means
there are many traps and devices.</i>

21
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,141
<i>The Tentacles crush
and break these devices</i>

22
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:41,020
<i>and they even grow on treasure chests,
working mischief together with the traps.</i>

23
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,189
<i>They're monsters
I want to see exterminated next to Mimics!</i>

24
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,358
There.

25
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,903
I think we made some
pretty good progress...

26
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,575
Strange.

27
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:57,494
The orcs must've used this path
to climb to the third floor.

28
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:59,955
How did they manage to navigate this area?

29
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,499
Something's here.

30
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,751
Be careful.

31
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:13,052
Kensuke!

32
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:14,803
It's a Giant Frog!

33
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,680
Ugh, so gross!

34
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:18,933
No way!

35
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,809
I got this! <i>Aslam!</i>

36
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,816
No!

37
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:31,153
Ambrosia!

38
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,037
Senshi, behind you!

39
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,542
Don't let go!

40
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:46,919
Hang in there, Senshi!

41
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,504
M-Magic...

42
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:50,923
- It should be close enough.
- No! It's too close!

43
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:52,800
<i>This is bad.</i>

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,176
<i>What do we do?</i>

45
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:57,304
<i>Is that a trap?</i>

46
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:01,183
<i>There's a Tentacles growing unnaturally
from the wall next to the frog.</i>

47
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:04,311
<i>It's probably growing out
of the exit of a trap.</i>

48
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:07,564
<i>If I can extract it,
I could trigger the trap.</i>

49
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:09,316
<i>But...</i>

50
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,277
<i>how do I pull it out?</i>

51
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:13,779
<i>If I touch it directly,
my hands will get swollen.</i>

52
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:18,200
Laios!

53
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:21,954
Why are Giant Frogs safe
even when in contact with the Tentacles?

54
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:24,707
Huh?

55
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:25,624
No idea.

56
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,459
Maybe it's their biological makeup.

57
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:30,462
<i>So, you don't have any info on this?</i>

58
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:33,465
Children can be inquisitive
regardless of the situation, huh?

59
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,050
Fine!

60
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:48,897
Chilchuck!

61
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,528
<i>It doesn't hurt!</i>

62
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,654
<i>I can do this!</i>

63
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,364
Huh?

64
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,575
<i>I can't pull it out!</i>

65
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,127
- Chilchuck!
- Chilchuck!

66
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,389
Chilchuck!

67
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,229
He's alive.

68
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,230
Show me your hands!

69
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:32,483
Huh? They're unhurt.

70
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:33,859
I see.

71
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:36,445
He wrapped his hands
with the skin of a Giant Frog.

72
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,363
Well done!

73
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:42,868
Chilchuck,

74
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:46,330
this is a really great idea!

75
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,875
<i>Dissect a Giant Frog</i>

76
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,628
<i>and remove the skin from its body.</i>

77
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,254
U-Um, hey...

78
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,548
Peel the Tentacles

79
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,511
and save the narrow sections for later.

80
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:02,513
Boil the thicker portions,

81
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:05,516
then, after boiling, mash them
and knead with flour.

82
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:09,019
Shape the mixture into sticks,
and slice them into bite-sized pieces,

83
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,979
and boil once more.

84
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:11,939
Hey...

85
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,525
Lightly dry the Giant Frog skins,

86
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:17,528
<i>take various measurements, and sew.</i>

87
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:21,156
Heat olive oil, garlic,
and hot pepper in a pan,

88
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:25,035
then add the thigh meat of a Giant Frog
and sauté them together.

89
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:26,495
- It's done!
- It's done!

90
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:29,039
TENTACLES GNOCCHI,
TENTACLES PASTA, FROG SUIT

91
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,416
<i>Ugh, just great!</i>

92
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,210
Bring them to me one person at a time!

93
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,296
You guys finished your tasks
while I was debating which of you to stop!

94
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,590
Come on, now, just give it a try.

95
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,593
Yes, give it a bite at least.

96
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:43,804
I said one person at a time!

97
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,932
And who knows
whether they're really safe or not?

98
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:50,644
WHISPER

99
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:54,398
I think you'll look
really cute in it, Marcille.

100
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,872
You look so cute!

101
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:11,540
The color really suits you.

102
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,793
I like how your ears are contributing
to that frog-like silhouette.

103
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:16,336
Let's get moving.

104
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,463
Right.

105
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,428
Wow! It doesn't hurt at all!

106
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,805
Ugh, this is so disgusting!

107
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:28,807
How beautiful.

108
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:31,059
It's delicious.

109
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,608
Kensuke!

110
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:38,817
Thank goodness!

111
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:42,321
Look!

112
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,240
It's the castle town.

113
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,409
We're already on the fifth floor!

114
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:54,416
There are signs
of people fleeing in panic.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,419
It seems the orcs were speaking the truth.

116
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,923
It's certain that there's
a Red Dragon around here.

117
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:04,009
Let's stay vigilant
and ready for combat as we move ahead.

118
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:07,304
Huh?

119
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:11,016
It seems like the Giant Frog's blood

120
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:14,561
has congealed inside
and got stuck to my clothes.

121
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:18,065
We didn't have enough time
to dry the skins, after all.

122
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:20,943
Are we going
to fight the dragon like this?

123
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:27,449
How am I supposed
to reunite with Falin now, huh?!

124
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,076
Answer me!

125
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:46,843
- It feels like my insides are spinning.
- Kiki, Kaka.

126
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:50,013
Show Namari to the guest room
so she can rest.

127
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:54,851
I will go to report
to the Lord of the Island.

128
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:04,861
<i>So, how was it inside the dungeon?</i>

129
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,531
The most concerning thing

130
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:09,866
is that it has become a rough place.

131
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,077
All the treasures down
to the third basement floor

132
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:13,579
have been plundered.

133
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:16,373
And there are now
more hangouts for outlaws.

134
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:17,791
<i>What's worse,</i>

135
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:23,130
<i>orc hordes have started appearing
on the upper floors and causing trouble.</i>

136
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,758
You should consider deploying a troop
or offering rewards to deal with them.

137
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:31,138
I wonder where the orcs entered from.

138
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:35,183
I suspect that some old dwarf mines
might be connected to the dungeon.

139
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:38,145
Orcs tend to inhabit such passages.

140
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,896
Dwarves, huh?

141
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:42,024
How abominable.

142
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:43,775
<i>They're like moles.</i>

143
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:47,029
<i>No matter how you seal off their passages,
they keep making more.</i>

144
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,530
<i>A long time ago,</i>

145
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,451
<i>the elves and dwarves divided
into the east and west in conflict.</i>

146
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:57,372
<i>They say the dwarves hid in these lands
and waited for the arrival of the elves.</i>

147
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,916
Even after the war,
they continued to dig tunnels,

148
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,795
eventually swallowing the Golden City
and turning it into a dungeon.

149
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,341
I hear that the surviving dwarves
are responsible

150
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,135
for the dungeon's ongoing expansion.

151
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,180
That rumor cannot be trusted.

152
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:16,683
Anyhow, here is the magic circle I copied.

153
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,186
It's in Elvish, like all the others.

154
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,606
And based on the handwriting,
the author is likely the same individual.

155
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:26,693
There are absolutely no traces
of anyone tampering with it.

156
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:28,654
The lord of the dungeon,

157
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:33,200
the lunatic magician,
is most certainly the one who made this.

158
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,619
Is he an elf?

159
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,621
I can't be certain,

160
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:40,749
but this magic is beyond
the capabilities of a tall-man or a dwarf.

161
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:42,459
What a tricky situation.

162
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:47,839
The thing is, I received a letter
from the western elves the other day.

163
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,844
<i>It said, "The dungeon is our heritage.
Return it to us."</i>

164
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:55,138
What a selfish demand!

165
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,391
They're the ones who took this land
from the dwarves

166
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,310
and handed it over to humans because
they didn't know what to do with it!

167
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,396
Ignore them.

168
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,732
This land was granted
by the king of the elves himself.

169
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,067
I can't just do that.

170
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,571
They'll take this island, too.

171
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,365
That won't do.

172
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:17,828
There must be great treasure
still hidden in that dungeon.

173
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:19,079
Lord of the Island,

174
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,957
the elves aren't after the treasure.

175
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:25,210
<i>They're after the spell of immortality
that is cast on the dungeon.</i>

176
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:29,506
The magic that ties the soul to the body
is still a big mystery.

177
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:34,719
When that mystery is solved,
its worth will far surpass that of gold.

178
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:37,889
We must figure it out before the elves do.

179
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,184
Are you suggesting we copy
every single magic circle to study them?

180
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:42,727
Listen carefully!

181
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:46,690
When such great magic is involved,
there is always a blueprint.

182
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,233
Get your hands on it!

183
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:50,485
As long as you have it,

184
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:53,864
you can give up the dungeon
or anything you please.

185
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:57,159
Once the elves know you possess it,

186
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,661
they will finally treat you as an equal,

187
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:04,040
no, they will kneel before you
to negotiate with you.

188
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,001
I-Is that so?

189
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:08,795
So? Where can I find this blueprint?

190
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,297
That's simple.

191
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,800
It's likely in the possession
of the lord of the dungeon.

192
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,220
In other words, you want me
to keep backing the explorers?

193
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,513
Precisely.

194
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,600
Don't bargain down the prices
for hunting monsters

195
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,059
and the loot from the dungeons.

196
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:26,521
Don't hoard your wealth
and provide even more support.

197
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:28,190
Very well.

198
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,817
I'll offer rewards for taking down orcs.

199
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,527
What do I say to the elves?

200
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:35,071
I'll help you buy time.

201
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:39,910
<i>Laios, was it?</i>

202
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,496
<i>He was a skilled adventurer,</i>

203
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,874
<i>but I wonder how far
his party can advance.</i>

204
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:53,924
Good morning, Namari.

205
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:55,509
How are you feeling?

206
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,512
My axe!

207
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,847
Your stuff is right here.

208
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:01,932
And

209
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,935
here's money from Grandpa Tansu.

210
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:08,021
It's more than I expected.

211
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,814
There might be a little break,

212
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:11,900
but he said he wanted
to request your help again.

213
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,944
T-Thanks.

214
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:15,153
I owe you.

215
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:17,822
I'll walk you to the street.

216
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,452
Do you have a home?

217
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:23,828
Or do you stay at an inn?

218
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,790
Neither. I'm heading toward the dungeon.

219
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,583
Why?

220
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,085
You're going under again?

221
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,294
No.

222
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:33,588
I have an errand to the nearby temple.

223
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,675
An errand?

224
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,102
It's the resurrection office.

225
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,604
Namari!

226
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:53,191
Is it true you left Laios' party?

227
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,945
So, what are you looking for?
An item or a person?

228
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:58,029
A person.

229
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:00,907
A female tall-man with light brown hair.

230
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,993
It's around shoulder length.

231
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:04,286
She's somewhere between...

232
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:07,706
her teens and her forties.

233
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:10,292
Wait. Do you mean Laios' sister?

234
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,336
She's in her twenties at most.

235
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,046
You should get your eyes checked.

236
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,550
It's hard to guess the age
of people from other races, okay?

237
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:22,679
We have no corpse here
that fits that description.

238
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:24,598
I see.

239
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,809
<i>On the fifth basement floor,</i>

240
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:32,188
<i>outside the Golden Castle,
lies the castle town.</i>

241
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:36,192
<i>The streets, expanded and warped by magic,</i>

242
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:41,197
<i>show traces of a time
when they bustled with activity.</i>

243
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:44,701
<i>Figures pass by the edge of your vision.</i>

244
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:47,203
<i>You hear whispers.</i>

245
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:50,540
<i>Such peculiar sensations wash over you.</i>

246
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,712
Seems like this was the location
for the orc settlement.

247
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,298
They must have left in quite a rush.

248
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,717
The pantry doors are left wide open.

249
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:02,594
What an awful stench.

250
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:05,221
Looks like the monsters in this area
scavenged this place.

251
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,183
It seems the flour and alcohol
are safe, though.

252
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,061
Let's make bread.

253
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:13,229
The orcs won't be happy
when they come back.

254
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:16,733
We gave them vegetables,
so it's a fair exchange.

255
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:30,914
Wargs.

256
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:33,959
It wasn't a fire, was it?

257
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,126
No.

258
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:37,545
They were defeated
by the Red Dragon's fire breath.

259
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,676
The dragon passed through here
not too long ago.

260
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,427
H-Hey.

261
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,471
You mentioned before

262
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:49,933
that dragons sleep most of the time
and rarely move about.

263
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:53,937
But based on what the orcs told us
and the current situation,

264
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:55,939
it's still on the move.

265
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:58,441
It's likely roaming
around this area even now.

266
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,820
We might've had a chance
against a sleeping dragon.

267
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,948
But do you really think we could defeat it
with our current strength?

268
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,200
What if we lose again?

269
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,452
What if she's already digested?

270
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:10,870
Calm down.

271
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,163
We don't know that yet.

272
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:13,957
Let's figure out a plan first.

273
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:15,875
But taking on the dragon

274
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,461
with just the three of you
is gonna be tough.

275
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,672
The three of us?

276
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:26,469
I keep telling you this,
but don't count on me to help in combat!

277
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:29,472
My only job
is to get you to your destination!

278
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,849
We know that.

279
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:32,767
We're not blaming you.

280
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,978
M-My mistake then.

281
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:38,398
How have you defeated dragons in the past?

282
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,359
It depends on the time, circumstances,
and the type of dragon.

283
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:44,863
<i>But usually, Falin casts a spell
to protect against fire and harm.</i>

284
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:47,407
<i>Then, Namari, Shuro, and I
work to slow it down.</i>

285
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:50,368
<i>Marcille weakens the dragon
with explosive spells.</i>

286
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:53,371
<i>Finally, Shuro strikes the killing blow
when the opportunity arises.</i>

287
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:56,040
I think that's how it usually goes.

288
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,878
Of course, it was only possible
because of that team.

289
00:16:59,878 --> 00:17:03,381
Now, we have to figure out a plan
for just the three of us.

290
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:06,843
<i>Dragons are resistant
to spells and weapons.</i>

291
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:10,013
<i>It's because they're covered
in steel-like scales.</i>

292
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,140
<i>Their only weak spot
where you can land a killing blow</i>

293
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,768
<i>is the underside of their neck.</i>

294
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,895
Stab it there, and we win!

295
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:18,521
The underside of their neck, huh?

296
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:22,150
How large is this Red Dragon?

297
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,735
Let's see...

298
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,779
Look over there.

299
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,739
See that half-collapsed walkway?

300
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,407
It's about that tall.

301
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:30,533
I mean,

302
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,745
isn't it broken
because the dragon bumped its head on it?

303
00:17:33,745 --> 00:17:35,288
You're right.

304
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,748
It's massive.

305
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:40,418
Striking it at that height
is almost impossible.

306
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,045
That's exactly the problem.

307
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,007
Let's make our way to the walkway.

308
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,969
It's so high.

309
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,472
What if we try jumping
onto the dragon's neck from here?

310
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,557
- No way!
- Forget it.

311
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,893
I can cast defense spells,

312
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:59,020
but I'm not as skilled as Falin.

313
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,898
I can't protect you
from a fall from this height

314
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:03,566
or from fire breath.

315
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:06,444
Yeah, what about its fire breath?

316
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:08,071
Up here, there's nowhere for us to run.

317
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:10,448
And according to Namari,

318
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,951
Senshi's axe won't even
make a dent in the dragon.

319
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:15,703
Are you sure your sword
can hurt it, Laios?

320
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:19,415
To cast an explosive spell
strong enough to stun a dragon,

321
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:21,876
I'll need you to buy me a lot of time.

322
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:24,712
On top of that,
someone needs to land the killing blow.

323
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:28,258
Can you and Senshi handle all that?

324
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:30,135
We'll find a way somehow.

325
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:31,511
How?

326
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:36,599
Rather than aiming for its head,

327
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:39,352
what if we blow up a building?

328
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:44,357
There are a lot of bridges and walkways
between buildings here.

329
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,110
We could set off an explosion
just as the dragon passes underneath.

330
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,654
The debris will trap the dragon,

331
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:51,823
bringing its weak spot within reach.

332
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:54,367
Then, we could strike
without worrying about a counterattack.

333
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,372
It's true that the two of us can't buy you
enough time to set up your spell.

334
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:02,876
But we could make a run for it
and lead the dragon on a chase.

335
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,045
The streets here are
too narrow for the Red Dragon,

336
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,882
and it's probably feeling worn out
after all its activity.

337
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:12,802
If we lead it along the right path,
we could tire it out even more.

338
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:14,137
I see.

339
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:15,555
I could help with that.

340
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,514
Really?

341
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,642
Thank you! You're the best!

342
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:22,353
Still, why isn't it sleeping?

343
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:24,647
Its appearance on the fifth floor
is a mystery, too.

344
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:27,942
It's persistently prowling
these narrow streets that it dislikes.

345
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,028
Could it be its mating season?

346
00:19:30,028 --> 00:19:31,029
No...

347
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:33,531
Hey, didn't Namari mention something

348
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:35,783
about Senshi's pot
being made of seriously tough metal?

349
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:37,368
What was it again?

350
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:40,872
"It shields against a dragon's something
and can shatter a dragon's something."

351
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:42,498
You're right!

352
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:44,792
She said every blacksmith dreams of it!

353
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,711
If it shields
against a dragon's something,

354
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:47,962
it's gotta be fire breath!

355
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:51,424
Well, that solves the fire breath problem.

356
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:54,302
Isn't your cooking knife
made from special metal, too?

357
00:19:54,886 --> 00:19:57,430
We should've had Namari take a look at it.

358
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,766
I'm feeling pretty hopeful now.

359
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,435
When you put your mind to it,
a way opens, huh?

360
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,394
All right!

361
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,563
Let's do our research
to map out our luring route!

362
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,042
So, you're back.

363
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:29,337
Senshi, you slipped away
without a heads-up!

364
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:30,838
I was making bread.

365
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:33,716
Did you have to do it right before
we're facing a dragon?

366
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,260
Absolutely.

367
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,387
We have a big mission ahead,

368
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:39,722
and the most important thing
is to fill our stomachs.

369
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,894
We lost to the Red Dragon
because of hunger once.

370
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:47,313
We shouldn't make the same mistake, right?

371
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,482
Wine!

372
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,485
I humbly took some from the pantry.

373
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,780
Save it for after we defeat the dragon.

374
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,949
We're missing eggs,

375
00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:00,368
but these should be enough
to make that dish.

376
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,789
Grate the bread into crumbs,

377
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:08,543
and marinate the Giant Frog meat
with salt and pepper.

378
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:11,546
Dip it in a water and flour batter,

379
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:13,047
and coat it with bread crumbs.

380
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:16,050
Heat up some olive oil, and deep fry.

381
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:22,807
Boil down red wine
with seasoning to make a sauce.

382
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:27,145
It's done!

383
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:29,564
CUTLETS TO CONQUER THE RED DRAGON

384
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:30,898
That looks amazing!

385
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,818
The smell is making me hungry.

386
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:35,820
- Let's dig in!
- Let's dig in!

387
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:38,823
It's so crispy!

388
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:43,953
Are you okay, Marcille?

389
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:47,248
The thought of not having
to eat monsters soon

390
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:48,583
is making me emotional.

391
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,085
There's still the Red Dragon, though.

392
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:57,800
Listen,

393
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,844
there's something
I want to say to you all.

394
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:03,347
I doubt I could've made it
all this way on my own.

395
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:06,100
Senshi, thank you so much.

396
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,978
You were kind
to complete strangers like us.

397
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:11,356
Your excellent cooking
not only satisfied our hunger

398
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:13,483
but it lifted our spirits as well.

399
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:16,903
Chilchuck, without you,
we would've had to take multiple detours,

400
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:18,696
which would have caused days of delay.

401
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:21,115
Above all, you were dependable.

402
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:22,950
And Marcille,

403
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,661
I'm sorry for the tough time you had
on this unfamiliar journey.

404
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:29,123
When you said you'd join me,
I was so moved.

405
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:32,835
Everyone, thank you so much.

406
00:22:36,464 --> 00:22:37,965
- S-Sure.
- S-Sure.

407
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,008
Poor timing!

408
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,510
Sorry.

409
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,014
What's this?

410
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,159
Seeing it again, it really is huge.

411
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,621
Could we really defeat it?

412
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:10,957
Don't worry.

413
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,459
The four of us have made it this far.

414
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:16,921
As per the plan,
Marcille will take her position,

415
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:19,215
and we'll lure the dragon!

416
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:21,217
Is everyone ready?

417
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:23,219
Is everyone in good shape?

418
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:25,304
All right.

419
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:27,348
Let's go!
