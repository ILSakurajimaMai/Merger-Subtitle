1
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:09,910
<i>Mình sẵn sàng rồi.</i>

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,913
<i>I can bring down this building anytime.</i>

3
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,668
<i>I still have a lot of magic left.</i>

4
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:21,297
<i>At this rate, I can step in for Laios
and the others if anything happens.</i>

5
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,092
<i>This plan is good, right?</i>

6
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,763
<i>I use up all my magic to stun the dragon.</i>

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,932
<i>Instead of using chancy explosive spells
against the dragon</i>

8
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,893
<i>at the risk of everyone's lives,</i>

9
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:36,771
<i>it's more reliable to bury the dragon
in the debris of a building.</i>

10
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:39,690
<i>Yes, this is definitely a better plan.</i>

11
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,234
<i>Stay calm.</i>

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,449
<i>I need to focus on my task.</i>

13
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:51,535
<i>We'll make this work!</i>

14
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,330
<i>Hang in there, Falin!</i>

15
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:22,918
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

16
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:53,032
It noticed us.

17
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:54,158
Run!

18
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,289
It's so fast!

19
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:03,584
Just so you know, a Red Dragon's
maximum speed is 60 kilometers per hour!

20
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,919
You should've said that earlier!

21
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:07,254
The terrain is slowing it down!
It's all good!

22
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:09,590
Turn right at the next corner!

23
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,891
We'll lure it to unleash its fire breath
on this straight path.

24
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,310
<i>Dragons breathe fire</i>

25
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,063
<i>by clicking their tongues
to ignite the fuel stored in their bodies.</i>

26
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:26,315
<i>To prevent it from lashing out
when we restrain it,</i>

27
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,068
<i>we'll make it use up
all its fuel along the way!</i>

28
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:32,321
It's clicking its tongue!

29
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,281
Here comes!

30
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,912
<i>What intense heat!</i>

31
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:41,080
<i>But...</i>

32
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,588
<i>Thanks to this pot and magic,
we can endure it.</i>

33
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:52,007
<i>Good. So far, so...</i>

34
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,260
<i>What?</i>

35
00:03:56,303 --> 00:04:00,307
<i>The heat of the pot
is spreading evenly and...</i>

36
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:02,309
So hot!

37
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:14,113
But of course, it's hot!

38
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:17,032
Senshi uses it for cooking every day!

39
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,868
Somehow, I thought it would have
a special resistance to dragon fire.

40
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,078
I thought Namari said

41
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:24,873
that adamant protects
against all dragon attacks.

42
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:27,209
She was just talking out of her hat!

43
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,502
I never said that.

44
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,965
Ugh, it's doing it again!

45
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,049
We have no choice!

46
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,426
We'll change our route!

47
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,392
Huh?

48
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:44,977
No way!

49
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:46,478
They're here already?

50
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:47,980
Aren't they a bit early?

51
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,482
Wait, what?

52
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:53,110
I thought the plan was to split in two!

53
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,863
Can I go ahead and stick to the plan?

54
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,823
Ugh, I don't understand!

55
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,992
Fine! Here goes!

56
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,419
No way!

57
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,796
It's not hurt at all!

58
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,215
Shh!

59
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:58,133
Don't move.

60
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,062
<i>Its inverse scale is right there.</i>

61
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:13,357
<i>A few more steps, and I could reach it!</i>

62
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:24,409
<i>It...</i>

63
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,454
<i>It ran away!</i>

64
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,872
<i>Damn it, Kensuke!</i>

65
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:30,124
<i>Never trust a monster...</i>

66
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,502
- You...
- Laios! Chilchuck! Get up!

67
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:35,420
Above us!

68
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:37,840
Hide under its belly!

69
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,216
Laios, you bastard!

70
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:41,093
My bad! I'm sorry!

71
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,052
Dammit!

72
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:44,513
The common language
doesn't have enough words of insult!

73
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:45,973
<i>Ponza! Toroldo!</i>

74
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,601
- <i>Unerma! Poojam! Varo! Monsanto! Belcher!</i>
- I'm being insulted in a strange language!

75
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:51,478
What are we gonna do now?

76
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:54,606
It's angry! It's super angry!

77
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:55,774
We have no choice.

78
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:57,609
Let's run from the side of its tail--

79
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:02,781
No, it's too dangerous.

80
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:05,451
What if we never manage to escape
from under its crotch?

81
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:10,038
This won't do!

82
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,124
A simple incantation
won't have any effect on it.

83
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:13,208
Focus!

84
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,386
What did you do that for?!

85
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,013
Our only weapon just got shattered!

86
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,515
What do we do now?!

87
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:30,350
We have no choice.

88
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,560
Use this.

89
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:32,978
What?

90
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:36,273
Is that really made of a special metal?

91
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:39,318
<i>It slices through the bone
and skin of every monster.</i>

92
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:42,237
<i>And I've diligently
taken care of it each day.</i>

93
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:44,281
<i>There's probably
no other like it on this earth.</i>

94
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,783
It's a mithril cooking knife!

95
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,619
Mithril?

96
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,786
Are you serious?

97
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,372
I wish Namari could've seen this.

98
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:55,125
Depending on the situation,
she might've killed Senshi.

99
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,462
I had a suspicion that she might,
which is why I chose to remain silent.

100
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,799
Take this!

101
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,929
It really pierced through its scale!

102
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:12,809
<i>But the blade is so short that no matter
where I strike,</i>

103
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,938
<i>I might not be able
to deliver a fatal blow.</i>

104
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,074
What should I do now?

105
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,451
This means the plan failed, right?

106
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,037
Or are they executing
a different strategy?

107
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:34,206
What am I supposed to do?

108
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,710
No time to hesitate!

109
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,712
Get back!

110
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:44,299
<i>My sword
is getting farther and farther away.</i>

111
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,719
If we continue retreating,
we'll end up in the open square.

112
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:50,222
Then, we'll be turned to cinder
by its fire breath!

113
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:52,724
I will draw its attention.

114
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:54,351
Don't! It's too risky!

115
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:57,479
Laios, you understand, don't you?

116
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:00,941
Among all the monsters
you've eaten so far,

117
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,485
was there one
that didn't give their utmost effort?

118
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:06,446
In this place,
it's a matter of eat or be eaten.

119
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,741
If we don't make desperate efforts,
we'll be the ones who'll be eaten.

120
00:09:10,242 --> 00:09:11,451
Brace yourself for the worst!

121
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,745
Senshi!

122
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:26,883
- Sen--
- Idiot!

123
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:29,261
There's no point if you rush out!

124
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,138
Retreat for now.

125
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,140
Figure something out with Marcille!

126
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,142
Hey! Are you still alive?

127
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,643
I'll help you out now--

128
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:41,607
Can you move?

129
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,579
<i>I did it!</i>

130
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:02,878
It's stuck to the ground.

131
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,046
Move aside!

132
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:08,508
Laios!

133
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:13,305
I'll be right back!

134
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:16,767
Senshi! Get up!

135
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:18,602
Sen--

136
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,323
Sorry, Marcille.

137
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:33,075
I didn't expect to find you here.

138
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:35,661
I'm glad my magic seems to be working.

139
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:38,789
What's going on? Where are the other two?

140
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:40,123
Things aren't looking good.

141
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,459
Every strategy we came up with has failed.

142
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,337
The other two are unconscious
at the dragon's feet.

143
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:47,839
What?! W-What do we do?!

144
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,801
Right, the only option is to use my magic.

145
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,220
The dragon is injured and agitated.

146
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,555
It's risky to approach it
or enter its line of sight.

147
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,974
But we have to do something quickly!

148
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,143
- Let's head upstairs.
- What?

149
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:02,270
W-What will you do?

150
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,231
I'll climb to the height
of the dragon's head.

151
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,233
- And stand inside the pot.
- What?

152
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,944
Then, I want you to blow it up.

153
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,988
What? Seriously?

154
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:14,491
<i>The dragon is blind in its left eye.</i>

155
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,118
<i>If I approach from its left side,</i>

156
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:18,954
I should be able to leap onto it
without being noticed.

157
00:11:19,454 --> 00:11:21,123
But...

158
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:24,042
<i>You did a similar maneuver before...</i>

159
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:26,837
<i>when you fought the Undine.</i>

160
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:30,549
But that was on the water with Water-Walk.

161
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:33,093
This time,
we have defense magic and the pot.

162
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,469
What happens next?

163
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:37,431
How will you stab its inverse scale
while clinging to its head?

164
00:11:38,348 --> 00:11:40,350
I have an idea about that.

165
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,645
There's no room for more failures.

166
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,773
I don't plan on failing.

167
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:53,029
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

168
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:55,031
<i>You do have a plan, right?</i>

169
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,950
<i>I believe in you.</i>

170
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,732
<i>I'll be flung off.</i>

171
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:30,734
<i>I need to execute my plan swiftly.</i>

172
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,986
<i>It'll be over in an instant.</i>

173
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,363
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

174
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:38,074
<i>Especially when compared...</i>

175
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:40,744
<i>to Falin's pain!</i>

176
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:44,998
Laios!

177
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:51,773
Laios!

178
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,234
Where are you going?

179
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,736
I heard there's a ghost at the graveyard.

180
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,488
Don't tell Dad or anyone else, okay?

181
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:01,575
- Whoopee!
- Whoopee!

182
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,248
Don't worry.

183
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,584
It's difficult to walk
with you clinging to me like that.

184
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,508
There's not even a single bug.

185
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:19,926
Let's head back, Falin.

186
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:23,680
Laios...

187
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,356
Laios!

188
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,070
<i>Take it off!</i>

189
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,573
<i>Help me.</i>

190
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:43,825
- <i>Please. Take it off.</i>
- <i>It's cold.</i>

191
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:46,494
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

192
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,831
Falin, run...

193
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,668
Laios!

194
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,676
Let my brother...

195
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:04,471
go!

196
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,194
It's someone who was buried in that grave.

197
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,614
His ring is binding his soul.

198
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:24,366
Remove it for him.

199
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,827
And his soul will be set free.

200
00:15:28,703 --> 00:15:29,663
A ring?

201
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,706
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:35,502
This is the grave of Olman,
who passed away recently.

203
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,881
When he was alive, he used to boast
about a golden ring he bought from an elf.

204
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,926
How did that child know about it?

205
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:48,723
Did I do something wrong?

206
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:51,267
You're incredible, Falin.

207
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,645
You have a knack for ghost magic.

208
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:55,855
Don't let it bother you.

209
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,024
Grown-ups are just scared of magic.

210
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:01,403
You should study proper magic.

211
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:03,113
You'll never be out of a job.

212
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:04,572
What kind of job?

213
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:05,573
Let's see.

214
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:08,076
You could become a priest
or a grave keeper.

215
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,578
Being a traveling exorcist
might be interesting, too.

216
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:16,668
You travel to foreign countries,
helping people in need.

217
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:18,503
That sounds fun.

218
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:21,089
If I do that, will you come with me?

219
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,298
Of course!

220
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:23,842
What country do you want to visit?

221
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,846
I'd love to see the sea.

222
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,889
Or even a desert.

223
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,642
They say there's a country
of talking dogs in the desert.

224
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:35,311
I definitely want to go there!

225
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,564
- <i>But...</i>
- <i>But...</i>

226
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:41,443
<i>maybe we shouldn't
travel together anymore.</i>

227
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,446
<i>Falin, why not?</i>

228
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,407
<i>You don't have to worry about me.</i>

229
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,870
<i>Goodbye, Laios.</i>

230
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,791
Laios, are you okay?

231
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,461
I stopped the bleeding for now.

232
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:00,920
Just hold on a bit longer.

233
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,882
I'll go look for the other two
and for your leg!

234
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:08,845
<i>"Don't worry about me"?</i>

235
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:12,390
<i>Don't say sad stuff like that.</i>

236
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:16,227
<i>I promise to bring you back.</i>

237
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:18,563
Hey!

238
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:21,024
Chilchuck!

239
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:22,859
Senshi!

240
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,737
There you are!

241
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,530
Thank goodness!

242
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,948
Are you okay?

243
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,075
Of course, not.

244
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,579
I need to work on my defense magic more.

245
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:38,208
At least we haven't suffered any ruptures,
so that's good enough.

246
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:44,214
<i>Tronsum Lunaae Stantinus Eurekant Oonzu.</i>

247
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,717
Ow!

248
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:50,512
Isn't he in more pain now?

249
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:53,973
When a serious injury is healed quickly,
you experience recovery pain.

250
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,350
Don't worry!

251
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,185
It's a sign that you've healed properly!

252
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,520
It's your turn, Senshi.

253
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,272
I'm fine. I'll heal on my own.

254
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:02,816
It could take months.

255
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,401
Falin was skilled at recovery magic,

256
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,196
but I'm pretty confident
in my speed as well.

257
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:11,241
T-That's the cause of the pain, isn't it?

258
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:12,951
GAAAAAAH

259
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:14,244
SNAP POP

260
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,246
Laios!

261
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,081
Come on, lift your leg.

262
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:29,592
<i>Britrayeums Lunae Actum
Asbam Histum Eres Eurekant Ounzu.</i>

263
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,514
It reattached!

264
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,768
The inside of my leg feels itchy.

265
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,770
It's recovery pain.

266
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,273
Well done, Laios.

267
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:46,526
You really defeated the Red Dragon.

268
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,403
It's thanks to all of you.

269
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:51,030
If any one of you weren't here,
we couldn't have won.

270
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,783
For a moment,
I was afraid of what might happen.

271
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:56,202
Even my blood froze.

272
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,288
Our estimate was a little too naive.

273
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,249
Well, we won, so that's all that matters.

274
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,042
But...

275
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,794
Here, Laios.

276
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:05,879
Kensuke.

277
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,048
I still haven't forgiven you for this yet.

278
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,759
You owe me a long explanation.

279
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,677
Right.

280
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:17,307
Well then, let's look inside its stomach.

281
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,943
What a thick skin.

282
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:30,528
Fighting with this cooking knife,

283
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,655
no wonder we couldn't even reach
its subcutaneous fat.

284
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:36,492
But it's going to be a lot of work
getting to its stomach.

285
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:38,453
I could try blasting it open.

286
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:41,956
The insides of a dragon
are no different from any other creature.

287
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:44,584
Let's slowly carve through its flesh.

288
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:54,636
It's one of its ribs.

289
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:56,971
Let's go around it and keep digging.

290
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:02,310
It's dark. Should we light a lantern?

291
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,603
No fire.

292
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,271
Marcille, light.

293
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:17,367
It's so hot.

294
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:20,495
It reminds me
of when I used to work in a mine.

295
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:23,748
What's this?

296
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:25,333
It's the stomach!

297
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,754
All right.

298
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:31,256
Let's open it.

299
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,517
It's empty.

300
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:44,727
It can't be...

301
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:47,021
Maybe we got the wrong dragon.

302
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:48,398
That's impossible.

303
00:20:48,398 --> 00:20:52,026
The scar above its eye
confirms it's the same dragon.

304
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:58,449
It's difficult to imagine there being
multiple territorial males in one area.

305
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,202
Let's examine its intestines as well.

306
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,999
N-Not even a fragment of a bone is left.

307
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,210
We have to examine its droppings, too!

308
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:13,756
Could its digestion have been sped up
by constant movement without sleep?

309
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,636
I got it!

310
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:39,949
What is this?

311
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:42,452
A mass of hair and bone.

312
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:44,662
Some creatures
that ingest their prey whole

313
00:21:44,662 --> 00:21:47,040
tend to regurgitate indigestible parts.

314
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,711
But instead of doing that, Red Dragons
use them as fuel for their fire breath.

315
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:55,798
These black hairs suggest
it consumed a few Wargs.

316
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:56,966
And...

317
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:02,472
H-Hair...

318
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:03,848
Could it be...

319
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:05,224
Let's sift through the mass.

320
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,643
We might find human bones in it.

321
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,608
Hey, isn't this staff...

322
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:16,819
Hey, Laios!

323
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,071
This staff!

324
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:24,035
F...

325
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:26,871
Falin?
