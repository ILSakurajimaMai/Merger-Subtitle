1
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,825
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,522
We're back!

3
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:39,275
- Nothing beats the air above ground.
- Here you go.

4
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,528
Is it morning or evening?

5
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,904
Don't touch the window yet!

6
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:45,031
You'll disrupt the teleportation spell!

7
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:45,949
Kabru.

8
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,701
Tomorrow, I'm going to report
to the Lord of the Island.

9
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,412
I want you to back up my story.

10
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:54,207
Are you going
to share everything with him?

11
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,418
There's no need to bring up
Laios and his party specifically.

12
00:01:58,128 --> 00:02:02,298
I just don't want Falin
to take any more lives.

13
00:02:02,382 --> 00:02:03,424
All right.

14
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,802
You should get some good rest today.

15
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:08,012
Check it out, Kuro!

16
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:09,180
Huge ship.

17
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:12,225
I wonder if it's packed with rich folks!

18
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,314
This is bad.

19
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:20,525
Toshiro,

20
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:23,027
I think we should head out right now.

21
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:24,445
What's this white ship?

22
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:27,073
It's a ship of the western elves.

23
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,325
See that figurehead of a little bird?

24
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,661
They're known as the Canaries.

25
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:36,583
<i>They show up when a dungeon's
danger level rises past a certain point.</i>

26
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,296
<i>Their mission is to investigate dungeons
and take control of them.</i>

27
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:45,633
Word had it they were applying pressure
on the Lord of the Island,

28
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:47,969
but it looks like they're
really cracking down now.

29
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,846
Is that even permitted?

30
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,931
This land belongs to tall-men.

31
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,144
Short-lived races are like infants
to elves and dwarves.

32
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:00,106
And the Lord of the Island
isn't skilled at negotiations.

33
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:01,399
<i>We should hurry.</i>

34
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:06,446
Hey!

35
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:08,781
It's you, Shuro.

36
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:10,074
Namari.

37
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,826
Where's Falin?

38
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,498
Laios and the others
haven't given up yet, though.

39
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:19,250
I see.

40
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,171
{\an8}Were they eating "you know what"?

41
00:03:23,254 --> 00:03:24,297
{\an8}They were.

42
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,508
We've come to see the Lord of the Island.

43
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,761
That's not possible.

44
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,764
Some important folks showed up suddenly,
and he's been in there since.

45
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:35,266
It's been hours now.

46
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,268
We're too late.

47
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:39,062
Let's go inside.

48
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:40,271
We can't do that.

49
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:43,399
If the elves get hold of the dungeon,
it's going to be over.

50
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:47,695
{\an8}My hometown also thrived
because of a dungeon.

51
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:51,282
<i>But one day, monsters flooded out,</i>

52
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:53,952
<i>the elves came, and many lost their lives.</i>

53
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,956
<i>Why did my family have to die?</i>

54
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:02,335
<i>My mother worked so hard
to raise me on her own.</i>

55
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,963
<i>She didn't deserve to die like that.</i>

56
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:09,342
I don't want to see that happen again.

57
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:12,595
{\an8}The existing system,
where only certain races wield power,

58
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,389
{\an8}is detrimental to everyone involved.

59
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:22,188
Excuse us.

60
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:25,108
We've come to make a report
to the Lord of the Island.

61
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:28,486
What is it?

62
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,738
As you can see,
we're in the middle of a discussion.

63
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,240
We ask you to leave.

64
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,493
It concerns
the current condition of the dungeon.

65
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,036
Please hear us out.

66
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,291
<i>I mustn't be intimidated.</i>

67
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:44,043
Keep it brief.

68
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,921
Just earlier, while exploring the dungeon,

69
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:50,425
<i>we encountered a human
who had been transformed into a monster.</i>

70
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,176
{\an8}- What?
- What?

71
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,220
Dammit. A Chimera.

72
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:55,930
It's advancing quicker than we thought.

73
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,849
See? What did I tell you?

74
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:00,601
I knew we couldn't afford
to leisurely wait for a response!

75
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,270
Order them to come ashore at once!

76
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:03,479
You have no right to do that!

77
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:05,857
Calm down, old man.

78
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,736
Borders become inconsequential
when lives are at stake.

79
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,156
You have no right to treat me as elderly!

80
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,742
Tansu, why don't we let them
have their way?

81
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:16,826
What?

82
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,619
I'm impressed, my lord.

83
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:20,246
You are flexible and wise.

84
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,248
Please place your seal here.

85
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:24,459
You mustn't! You can't!

86
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,587
That just made matters worse.

87
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,255
<i>If only...</i>

88
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,633
<i>I had the ability
to take control of the dungeon,</i>

89
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:34,135
<i>there wouldn't be an issue.</i>

90
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:35,803
<i>But it was beyond me.</i>

91
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:40,933
<i>So I began searching for ways
to assist other capable adventurers.</i>

92
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:46,105
<i>But the majority of them turned out
to be self-centered and insignificant.</i>

93
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:50,860
<i>Just as I resolved to tackle
the dungeon myself,</i>

94
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:53,738
<i>I heard rumors about the Touden siblings.</i>

95
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,865
He must come from good stock.

96
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:59,118
He's got good instincts,
but he's just too selfless.

97
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,912
Anyway, he's weird.

98
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,582
<i>The more I looked into him,
the stranger he seemed.</i>

99
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:08,336
<i>He's not particularly strong, yet he
somehow made it to the lower levels.</i>

100
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,672
<i>Giving money to folks with nothing
but bad gossip surrounding them.</i>

101
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,132
<i>His mysterious background.</i>

102
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,218
<i>His odd companions.</i>

103
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,846
<i>But for some reason,
I had a hunch that this man</i>

104
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,266
<i>might play a big part
in the fate of this island.</i>

105
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:25,937
<i>The question is
whether it'll be for better or worse.</i>

106
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:29,565
<i>I've been eager to talk with him in person
and form my own opinion.</i>

107
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,276
<i>And after finally conversing with him,
I've become convinced.</i>

108
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:35,613
<i>All he cares about are monsters.</i>

109
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,616
<i>He's incapable of considering
the future of the island.</i>

110
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,410
<i>It shouldn't be left in his hands,
but I'm sure of one thing.</i>

111
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:43,079
<i>Currently,</i>

112
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:46,999
<i>among all the tall-men, he's the closest
to reaching the heart of the dungeon.</i>

113
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,962
<i>This could be his one and only chance.</i>

114
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,756
<i>Therefore,
I can't let the elves interfere.</i>

115
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,551
{\an8}<i>Dealing with him must wait until later.</i>

116
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:58,636
I've had enough of this.

117
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:00,388
Do as you please.

118
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,389
My lord!

119
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:02,974
Give the order to come ashore.

120
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:04,183
Please wait!

121
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:07,645
The dungeon's layout, environment,
and the types of monsters within

122
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,772
are undergoing drastic changes.

123
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:11,149
It's extremely unstable.

124
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,276
We're well aware of that.

125
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,820
It's a natural occurrence
during a dungeon's expansion.

126
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,905
We must halt it without any delay.

127
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,074
It's similar to a person's growth spurt,

128
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:22,910
a phase that requires
the most nourishment.

129
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,162
What're you talking about?

130
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,289
Fifteen years ago, my hometown

131
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:28,958
was destroyed because of a dungeon.

132
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,794
It was a town called Utaya.

133
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:33,463
Fifteen years ago?

134
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:34,422
That means...

135
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:37,550
Are you the kid
who survived that incident?

136
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:41,471
I heard that the vice commander
at the time took you in.

137
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:42,388
That's right.

138
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:44,474
I was in her care for a few years.

139
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:45,391
Hmm.

140
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,935
She must've doted on you,
and yet you became an adventurer.

141
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,564
I dreamt of enlisting,
but the racial barrier stood in my way.

142
00:07:52,064 --> 00:07:54,025
But I wanted to do what I could

143
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:56,360
to prevent another tragedy
like the one in my hometown.

144
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:57,862
How admirable.

145
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,197
Are you making enough to eat?

146
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,866
You should visit her and show her
how you're doing once in a while.

147
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,201
And?

148
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,786
You mentioned nourishment.

149
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,954
What about it?

150
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:08,206
Continue.

151
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:11,209
{\an8}Thanks to your efforts,

152
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,961
{\an8}the dungeon in Utaya collapsed swiftly.

153
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:18,216
<i>But many soldiers
and citizens lost their lives.</i>

154
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,343
<i>Because the dead turned into monsters</i>

155
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:22,720
<i>and ate people alive.</i>

156
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:26,224
<i>I heard there were many soldiers
who were ambushed from behind.</i>

157
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:29,602
Even if you charge in with sheer numbers,
it will be like Utaya all over again.

158
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:32,230
I propose sealing the dungeon.

159
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,358
{\an8}We must not feed it.

160
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:40,154
Damaging the dungeon through combat
can't be what you want either.

161
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,114
What about the people still inside?

162
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:44,283
Most of them are on the first level.

163
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,702
We'll evacuate them gradually.

164
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:49,705
Everyone has some connections.

165
00:08:50,373 --> 00:08:52,708
I know people I can reach out to
for assistance.

166
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,835
Please let me handle this!

167
00:08:58,714 --> 00:08:59,882
<i>This guy</i>

168
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:02,760
<i>ate monsters with a background like that?</i>

169
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,723
Hey, begin preparations.

170
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:10,518
- For an investigation.
- Huh?

171
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:14,146
{\an8}You're up to something, aren't you?

172
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,983
Since you insist,
let's see what you can do.

173
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,653
If anything happens,
we'll send in troops at once.

174
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:22,405
Am I clear?

175
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,073
Yes.

176
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:34,500
Is it like scrambled eggs?

177
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:35,501
Huh?

178
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:38,462
You once likened souls to eggs.

179
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,132
If two souls are blended together,

180
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:44,635
what kind of egg would that be like?

181
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,095
For example,

182
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:50,808
a scrambled egg is entirely different
from a sunny side up.

183
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:51,809
Listen.

184
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,561
I didn't use an egg to illustrate a soul

185
00:09:53,644 --> 00:09:56,147
so you could jump on my words
and play with them.

186
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,648
Is that so?

187
00:09:57,732 --> 00:10:01,527
I thought it was quite a clever metaphor.

188
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:05,615
Nothing has as many properties as an egg.

189
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:08,451
Consider, for example,
its coagulation temperature.

190
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:11,037
The whites and yolks coagulate
at different temperatures.

191
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,998
It can be whipped, used as a moisturizer,
and serve as an adhesive.

192
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,167
What's interesting
is its emulsifying ability.

193
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,837
Despite water and oil
being natural opposites,

194
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,590
eggs can blend them together nicely,
under the right conditions.

195
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:23,883
Like so.

196
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,010
Well...

197
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,387
True, why did I liken souls to eggs?

198
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:31,724
Laios, fetch me the bread over there.

199
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,569
It's done!

200
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:46,280
SOUL EGGS BENEDICT

201
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:49,784
How do you eat this?

202
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,286
Use a fork and knife.

203
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,247
Scoop up the yolk and sauce
with the bread.

204
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:03,047
Naturally, it's delicious.

205
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:06,550
Izutsumi,

206
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:09,553
would you stop glancing around at nothing?

207
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:10,930
Or do you actually see something?

208
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,306
Not really.

209
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,059
I just thought I sensed a presence.

210
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:16,936
What?

211
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:19,688
{\an8}Maybe what I'm seeing
isn't a hallucination!

212
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:21,690
Huh?

213
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,694
Well, the other day
when I had mana sickness,

214
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:28,489
I mentioned seeing
and hearing things, right?

215
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,324
It's been going on this whole time.

216
00:11:30,408 --> 00:11:32,618
This whole time? Why didn't you tell us?

217
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:35,621
Because he'd be quick to think
there's something wrong with my head.

218
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:37,039
Am I wrong, though?

219
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:39,708
What are the hallucinations like?

220
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,714
I hear someone talking to me constantly.

221
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:48,717
<i>At first, I couldn't make out the words.</i>

222
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:52,096
<i>But over time, both its voice
and form have become clearer.</i>

223
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,474
<i>I was scared, so I've been
trying to ignore it, but...</i>

224
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:58,561
So you could hear me all along.

225
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:01,313
What did it say just now?

226
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:04,608
It's upset because I've been ignoring him.

227
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,735
Is it safe to talk with it?

228
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,279
Does it feel evil?

229
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,948
Yeah. If anything, I'd say so.

230
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,284
Hey.

231
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,952
How can I help you?

232
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,539
What's it saying?

233
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,876
It's upset I'm treating it like a fiend.

234
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:24,170
Also...

235
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:28,424
it's saying, "Aren't you grateful
I saved you from the magician?"

236
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:29,550
Huh?

237
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:32,386
<i>I remember now!</i>

238
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,014
That did happen, didn't it?

239
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,515
Thank it for us.

240
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,519
It wants us to meet someone.

241
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:41,896
What should we do?

242
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,731
This someone better not be a Grim Reaper.

243
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:45,900
Well, we don't really have other options.

244
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:49,069
Okay! Take us to this person!

245
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:29,610
What?

246
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,111
This place...

247
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:33,113
Hey!

248
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:35,115
Watch out!

249
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,701
A U-Unicorn!

250
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:42,498
You guys,
are you from outside by any chance?

251
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:45,376
No, we were in the dungeon and...

252
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,835
This is a big deal!

253
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,962
Come with me!

254
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:58,138
The monsters are so tame.

255
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:01,475
They're under orders not to hurt us.

256
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:04,770
But you outsiders are different.

257
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,481
Always keep the village's things on you.

258
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:10,776
Izutsumi, what's the matter?

259
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,278
Is it teleportation sickness?

260
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:14,029
Maybe the fatigue's getting to her.

261
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,491
Is that the Golden Castle?

262
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:18,409
Yup.

263
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:21,328
We were brought here by some ghosts.

264
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,414
Are they residents here?

265
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:24,540
They are.

266
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:27,877
But you can hear all about it
from the person you're about to meet.

267
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,630
I don't really understand
why you guys were chosen either.

268
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,882
"Chosen"?

269
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:35,676
Here we are.

270
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,802
Sit tight for a bit.

271
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,308
The master's gone to worship.

272
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,687
- It's them.
- What?

273
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,897
These guys?

274
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:51,442
Seems you were out of luck a bit.

275
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:55,946
Make yourselves comfortable in the village
until the master comes home.

276
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,700
{\an8}It seems like everyone's dying
to look after you guys, anyway.

277
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:02,077
{\an8}What should we show you?

278
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,204
{\an8}There isn't much to see in this village.

279
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,874
{\an8}Are they all residents
of the Golden Castle?

280
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:08,626
{\an8}I don't see any elderly people around.

281
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:11,921
{\an8}I want to see where the monsters are kept.

282
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:16,216
{\an8}I'd like to check out the fields
we passed on our way here.

283
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,636
What? That's what you're interested in?

284
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,846
Sure, we can take you there.

285
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,389
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

286
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:25,351
I'll wait here.

287
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:28,062
We can't leave Izutsumi alone anyway.

288
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,104
I'll stay too.

289
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:31,148
A-A Minotaur...

290
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:32,858
Female?!

291
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:35,736
They're our milk cows.

292
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:37,655
Why use monsters as livestock?

293
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:38,572
Huh?

294
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:41,116
Well, regular livestock
was hard to acquire.

295
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:54,254
This is a fine, well-tended field.

296
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:57,341
Do the villagers consume all the produce?

297
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,843
Actually, there's a lot of waste.

298
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:03,263
But without fields,
there's nothing for us to do.

299
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:06,558
We're maintaining them to replicate
our lifestyle from above ground.

300
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:07,726
Oh!

301
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:12,147
Izutsumi, are you okay?

302
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,403
<i>At least she doesn't seem to be unwell.</i>

303
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,864
Um, could we get a moment of your time?

304
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,410
Dresses?

305
00:16:24,493 --> 00:16:25,494
Exactly!

306
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:27,246
We make clothes!

307
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,498
We usually take turns dressing up,

308
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:31,667
but it's become monotonous
with the same members.

309
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,836
I'd be happy to help.

310
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,296
Which one should we try?

311
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,173
I think we should go with red.

312
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:39,299
Sorry,

313
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:42,386
they might seem old-fashioned to you.

314
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:44,304
I wouldn't say that.

315
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,311
<i>This isn't quite what I was expecting.</i>

316
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:55,691
<i>I suppose being isolated from the outside
for a millennium would alter fashion too.</i>

317
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:57,067
Try these next!

318
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:01,572
That's good!

319
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,782
I'm pretty particular about my drinks,

320
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,451
but this is pretty decent.

321
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:06,785
I'm honored.

322
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,996
I serve it to orcs sometimes,

323
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,457
and the latest batches
have been quite popular.

324
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,293
It's really nice.

325
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:16,712
Do you happen to make wine as well?

326
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:19,715
I've actually just begun recently.

327
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:22,342
But compared to the ale
that I've been brewing for 400 years,

328
00:17:22,426 --> 00:17:23,343
it's been a bit tricky.

329
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:24,928
Four hundred years?

330
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:26,680
That's a long-standing brewery!

331
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:28,140
What generation are you?

332
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:31,351
I began when I was 600 years old,
so I'm the first generation.

333
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,353
I see.

334
00:17:34,313 --> 00:17:37,107
They let me milk a Minotaur!

335
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,609
That's cool.

336
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:40,235
Keep it to yourself.

337
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,987
This is incredible!

338
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:45,741
They've completely succeeded
in cultivating monsters here!

339
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:49,536
Just look at that vast Dryad farm!

340
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,663
They've got four nipples, just like a cow!

341
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:54,166
This is making me feel sick.

342
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,753
Anyway, it was an amazing experience.

343
00:17:57,836 --> 00:17:59,421
Milking a--

344
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:01,924
Speaking of which,
where are Marcille and Izutsumi?

345
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:03,717
How did that bring them to mind?

346
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,136
S-Sorry for the wait.

347
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,268
What's up with your outfits?
You're having too much fun!

348
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:14,770
It's not like that!

349
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,772
They wanted us to, and we couldn't say no.

350
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:20,484
I did choose the tamest one, you know.

351
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,401
NOT TAME

352
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,654
Marcille, you...

353
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,115
W-What?

354
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,661
Why is Izutsumi so attached to you?

355
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:32,162
That's your question?

356
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,039
I wonder too!

357
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:38,335
It's like she's regressed to infancy.

358
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:40,295
Hmm!

359
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:41,463
No!

360
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:45,676
There are multiple barriers
layered on top of each other here.

361
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,179
So maybe they're somehow interfering
with something inside Izutsumi.

362
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:51,515
Because she's half-monster?

363
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,432
Yeah.

364
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:56,603
I've never encountered a barrier that
suppresses aggression in monsters before.

365
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:00,190
If only I could decipher this.

366
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,526
{\an8}But there are too many
unfamiliar characters,

367
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,944
{\an8}I can't solve it overnight!

368
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:07,823
Everything I try to study
is censored these days!

369
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,201
But this place is really amazing.

370
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:15,956
If it weren't for this situation,
I'd have loved to remain here forever.

371
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,417
Me too.

372
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:26,341
Sorry for the wait.

373
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:29,720
Although modest,
we've prepared a meal for you.

374
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:30,929
Please follow me.

375
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,019
Welcome, everyone.

376
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,729
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

377
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:40,772
My name is Yaad.

378
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:44,735
I'm the grandson of Delgal,
whom you must be familiar with.

379
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,069
Delgal...

380
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,863
Please take a seat.

381
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:52,492
I'll share with you the long tale
of why I've summoned you here.

382
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,369
Serve them.

383
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,665
VEGETABLES IN SLIME ASPIC
BEEF RIB STEAK

384
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:00,626
BLADE FISH LOAF
POTATO AND RABBIT SOUP

385
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,878
Um, what kind of meat is this?

386
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:06,048
Right. As your group
specifically requested,

387
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:07,758
it's Minotaur meat.

388
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:13,055
Do you regularly eat monsters too?

389
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:17,017
Some do,
but we generally don't eat at all.

390
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:20,771
Partly because
our sense of taste has diminished,

391
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:24,191
but in the first place,
we don't experience hunger at all.

392
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:29,738
That's the curse of immortality
the lunatic magician has placed on us.

393
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:35,035
Why did the magician do such a thing?

394
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:36,495
{\an8}Who knows?

395
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:38,705
{\an8}By the time I was old enough
to understand things,

396
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:42,251
{\an8}he was no longer in a state
to hold proper conversations.

397
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:46,463
But don't concern yourselves about us.

398
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,632
Please, enjoy your meal.

399
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:53,553
We might not feel any hunger,
but it pleases us to watch others eat!

400
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:58,058
<i>- I can't say I don't want to eat now!
- I can't say I don't want to eat now!</i>

401
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:01,436
My grandfather...

402
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:07,276
<i>blamed himself for turning
the magician's focus on black magic.</i>

403
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,278
<i>And he agonized over it for a long time.</i>

404
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,532
<i>Eventually, he headed to the surface
seeking assistance.</i>

405
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,577
How is my grandfather
known on the surface?

406
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,746
As far as I've heard,

407
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,708
he emerged suddenly from
an underground graveyard near a village.

408
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,668
<i>He named himself
the king of a fallen kingdom,</i>

409
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:28,839
<i>and offered the entire realm to anyone
who could defeat the lunatic magician.</i>

410
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:30,716
<i>Then, he turned to dust.</i>

411
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,467
Is that so?

412
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:35,220
At least there's some solace in knowing

413
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:37,472
that he has been liberated
from his suffering.

414
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:41,601
Many have left the village
seeking to escape the curse.

415
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:44,146
But none have succeeded.

416
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:46,565
They've simply lost their flesh.

417
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,569
<i>Without their bodies,
they gradually lost their identities,</i>

418
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:54,489
<i>transformed into fiends,
and are unable to return here.</i>

419
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:57,034
You must've encountered some of them.

420
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:58,368
<i>- We have!
- We have!</i>

421
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:01,121
- <i>We blasted them with holy water</i>
- <i>We blasted them with holy water</i>

422
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:02,873
- <i>and made sorbet out of it too!</i>
- <i>and made sorbet out of it too!</i>

423
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,125
S-So,

424
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,502
what's the reason behind inviting us here?

425
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:08,795
The prophecy.

426
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:09,838
The prophecy?

427
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:10,756
That's right.

428
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:14,009
"There will come one
bearing a winged sword,

429
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:18,889
who will defeat
the lunatic magician and free us."

430
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:20,098
Winged?

431
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:21,516
Does that mean Kensuke?

432
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,019
It does have wings, but...

433
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:27,147
Huh? It has a lion's face on it!

434
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,523
When did that happen?

435
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:31,943
<i>The Winged Lion
is the guardian deity of this kingdom.</i>

436
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:36,114
<i>The lunatic magician has imprisoned it
at the depths of the dungeon.</i>

437
00:22:36,698 --> 00:22:41,787
<i>But even now, through dreams,
it prophesies the future and guides us.</i>

438
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,791
<i>My grandfather also left for the surface
because of a prophecy.</i>

439
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,543
Sir Laios,

440
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:50,921
the prophecy continues like this.

441
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:55,926
"The bearer of the winged sword
will defeat the lunatic magician,

442
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,679
and become the new king of this kingdom."

443
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:02,224
You've got the wrong person!

444
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:04,601
He only picked up this sword by chance!

445
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:06,019
It wasn't chance.

446
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:10,607
The fact that it's here now
suggests it was predestined.

447
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:14,194
Sir Laios,

448
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:16,947
will you give us your word?

449
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,825
That you will defeat the lunatic magician

450
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:22,035
and liberate us.

451
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:24,329
I...

452
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:25,372
Um...

453
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:33,338
Please let me think about it.

454
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:35,715
Just say no.

455
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,218
Why are you giving them false hope?

456
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:40,470
I can't just turn them down.

457
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:41,930
Kensuke,

458
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:44,599
when did you undergo your transformation?

459
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:48,145
It might have happened
when the Dungeon Cleaners got to it.

460
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:52,440
I was so nervous

461
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:55,235
that I couldn't really taste
the food they prepared.

462
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:57,445
You shameless bastard!

463
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,240
How dare you make a request on our behalf!

464
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:03,743
In truth, it barely had any taste at all.

465
00:24:04,494 --> 00:24:07,998
They mentioned they don't need to eat.

466
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:11,543
That's why
their cooking skills are lacking.

467
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:14,254
I've been thinking.

468
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:18,925
<i>They shouldn't need fields or dishes.</i>

469
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,261
<i>So why do they have them?</i>

470
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:27,267
<i>Why do they persist in cleaning
and maintaining them for a millennium?</i>

471
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:30,896
It must be because they depended on them

472
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:35,567
to stay sane and to keep on living.

473
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:37,819
Laios,

474
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:43,742
I remember what you said to the orc chief.

475
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:44,659
Huh?

476
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,662
What did I say again?

477
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:51,082
Well, you should sleep on it for a night.

478
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:55,420
Can I stay here too?

479
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,464
Sleep in the room they prepared for you.

480
00:24:57,547 --> 00:24:59,174
I don't want to be alone!

481
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:01,218
Izutsumi is acting weird too.

482
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:02,636
Scoot over.

483
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,179
Sleep on the floor!

484
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:06,264
<i>His hands were cold.</i>
