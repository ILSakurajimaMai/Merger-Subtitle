ORIGINAL WORK BY RYOKO KUI

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,980
<i>It all started in a small village.</i>

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,740
<i>One day, a rumble in the ground
caused a rift under the cemetery,</i>

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,570
<i>from which a single man appeared.</i>

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,330
<i>He claimed to be the king
of a once prosperous kingdom.</i>

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,870
<i>He states that the once glorious land</i>

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,830
<i>continues to be held captive
deep underground</i>

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,590
<i>by the hands of a mad magician.</i>

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,510
<i>To whomever defeats this magician,</i>

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,760
<i>he offers everything his kingdom has.</i>

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,680
<i>After he imparts these words,
he turns to dust and vanishes.</i>

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,980
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,200
Keep it up, everyone.

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,120
We've only got a bit left
after this dragon.

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,120
Let's go!

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,870
<i>We're completely prepared.</i>

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,130
<i>Nothing can get in our way.</i>

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,720
<i>That's not true.</i>

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,470
<i>We're hungry.</i>

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,220
<i>Everyone's movements lack
their usual edge.</i>

21
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,060
<i>We lost a day roaming around
due to a misprint on our map.</i>

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,360
<i>We walked into a trap
and lost three days' worth of food.</i>

23
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,740
<i>It's bothersome, but we should turn back
for a bit after defeating the dragon.</i>

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,950
Laios!

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,700
<i>What happened, Falin?</i>

26
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,950
<i>Did they cast a confusion spell on you?</i>

27
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,460
<i>Wh...</i>

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
<i>What?</i>

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,460
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

30
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,220
<i>We're all dead?
We're so deep in the dungeon.</i>

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,220
R-Run.

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,110
Laios.

33
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,570
You're awake.

34
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,160
It looks like a magic spell
got us out of the dungeon,

35
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,120
but Falin's the only one we can't find.

36
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,960
She was eaten.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,960
What?

38
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,170
Her magic didn't work
from inside the dragon's stomach.

39
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,630
That can't be.

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,340
She's probably still in the dungeon.

41
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,930
Let's go now to save her.

42
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,930
Hold on.

43
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,810
Honestly, it looks like almost everything
we had was left behind in the dungeon.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,900
So we're basically cleaned out.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,230
What?

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,110
And what's worse...

47
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,230
Chilchuck?

48
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,240
We just lost two of our party members.

49
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
RESIGNATION LETTER

50
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,240
What's that?

51
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,330
Apparently another party's
been courting them for a while now.

52
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,750
What?

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,750
<i>Exploring dungeons costs money</i>

54
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,750
<i>for hiring companions,
buying equipment, and getting food too.</i>

55
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,210
<i>We can sell our current equipment
and secure what funds we have now</i>

56
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,590
<i>to switch to cheaper equipment.</i>

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,260
<i>As well as to pay for food, medicine,
necessities, and new companions.</i>

58
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,770
- Do we have enough?
- Not in the slightest.

59
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,900
My little sister will get digested
while we get everything ready.

60
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,230
There's that person who once revived
someone from shreds, right?

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,650
Have they ever revived someone from poop?

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,490
Never heard of that.

63
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,830
I know we're short on cash,

64
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,620
but how about some food first?

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,120
After all, our empty stomachs
may have been why we failed.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What should we eat?

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,500
For cheap food, we could go to
the bistro on the main street,

68
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,920
or there's The Laughing Wolf
for bigger meals.

69
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,930
Oh, but that pub's hard to pass up too!

70
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,050
Their soup dumplings are to die for.

71
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,680
- No.
- What?

72
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,350
We need to get back to the dungeon.

73
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,770
But as we are now...

74
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,560
I have an idea.

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,820
- You two will leave the party.
- What?

76
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,940
Then, we'll sell your equipment
and I'll enter the dungeon alone.

77
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,360
That's insane.

78
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,450
Do you have a death wish?

79
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,240
This way, we won't have to compromise
on using quality equipment,

80
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,700
and I can get to the lowest floor
while avoiding monsters if I'm alone.

81
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,710
It's not impossible.

82
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,960
It's all my fault in the first place.

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,750
I can't put you two in danger too.

84
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,550
I'm going too, no matter what.

85
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,840
I'll do anything to save Falin.

86
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,050
Falin is dear to me too.

87
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,640
I won't drag you down.

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,560
You know how strong my magic is.

89
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,560
Don't forget about my job, too.

90
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,190
You'll need me to open doors
and disable traps.

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,940
You guys...

92
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,200
You really mean to go with me, right?

93
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,200
For better or for worse?

94
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,790
Y-Yeah.

95
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,960
We'll secure food from within the dungeon.

96
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,960
- What?!
- What?!

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,750
There are more than enough
monsters in the dungeon.

98
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,970
That means an entire ecosystem
exists inside.

99
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,010
Carnivorous monsters will have
herbivorous monsters to feed on,

100
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,220
and the herbivorous monsters eat plants

101
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,970
that find nutrients
from water, sunlight, and dirt.

102
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,230
In other words,
humans can eat in the dungeon too.

103
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,860
So, what you're saying

104
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,860
is that we'll eat monsters?

105
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,820
We'll eat monsters too.

106
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,110
Think about our adventures until now.

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,620
I'm sure there were
a lot of tasty-looking things.

108
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,000
No, there's no way I'm eating those.

109
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,370
There are quite a bit of people
who hunt monsters for food.

110
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,670
You mean the criminals
who can't come back on land?

111
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,130
Even they get hospitalized
all the time from food poisoning.

112
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,380
You said you'd do anything to save Falin.

113
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,140
I never said I'd eat monsters.

114
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,220
There's no time nor money.
What other choice do we have?

115
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,350
But there's no point
if we eat something weird

116
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,730
and get stopped by food poisoning.

117
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,770
Run away!

118
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,150
Save us!

119
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,700
Looks like dungeon newbies.

120
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,200
They're not cut out for this
if they can't handle a monster like this.

121
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,200
Hey, Laios?

122
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,960
Let's make lunch out of this.

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,830
I refuse!

124
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,590
No, absolutely not!

125
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,710
Isn't going straight to mushrooms
a bit risky?

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,590
The dungeon food guide
says it's food suited for beginners.

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,430
It's meaty and has a mild taste.

128
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,060
- What is this book?
- It looks pretty worn down.

129
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,350
Let's go find more space
to start a fire.

130
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,900
Wish we had one or two
more ingredients, though.

131
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,190
Those steps are from a Huge Scorpion!

132
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,610
Could it be that he...

133
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,700
<i>Despite being a dungeon,
many people come and go,</i>

134
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,200
<i>making it a bustling place
for adventurers and merchants.</i>

135
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,290
<i>A former cemetery,</i>

136
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,370
<i>it was once a sacred place
where villagers slept in peace.</i>

137
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,750
<i>But once it was connected to
the dungeon six years ago,</i>

138
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
<i>it became the liveliest place
in the village.</i>

139
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,010
<i>They say monsters emerge
from the depths of the dungeon.</i>

140
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,140
<i>It is unclear whether a forbidden spell
transformed terrestrial creatures</i>

141
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,520
<i>or if they were summoned
from the world of monsters.</i>

142
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,440
<i>But they all have an odd appearance</i>

143
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,360
<i>and attack humans as if
they have something to protect.</i>

144
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,150
<i>But that served as the only proof we have</i>

145
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,530
<i>that the cursed,
formerly prosperous capital truly exists.</i>

146
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,080
Don't kill it like a crayfish.

147
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,620
This is how you catch it,
so it's easier than a crayfish.

148
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,790
Hey.

149
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,090
You've been looking for a chance
to eat monsters for a while, haven't you?

150
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,220
But that doesn't change the fact
that I want to save my sister.

151
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Yeah, okay.

152
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,300
I've never told you this,
but I love monsters.

153
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,680
from their appearance and cries
to their ecology.

154
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,100
I soon wanted to know their taste.

155
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,270
He's a psychopath.

156
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,280
Shouldn't we do this
where there are fewer people?

157
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,570
It's hard to go back and forth for water.

158
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,990
So, how do we eat these?

159
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Let's try an orthodox approach.

160
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,330
What's wrong?

161
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,840
It's easy to cut from above,
but there's resistance from the side.

162
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,050
When we fight against
mushroom-type monsters,

163
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,920
slashing diagonally or horizontally
might be less effective.

164
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,840
That's good to know.

165
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,800
It looks like food if you slice it up.

166
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,720
I don't see it.

167
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,850
Hey, hold on!

168
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,400
We're eating it as is?
What about the venom?

169
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,020
This scorpion's venom is safe to eat.

170
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,650
Really?

171
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,240
That's what the book said,
so I want to try it.

172
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,490
Blech.

173
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,700
Told you.

174
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,870
Hold it right there.

175
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,910
Scorpion Hot Pot, eh?

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,870
But that method leaves much to be desired.

177
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
Who are you?

178
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,550
When you eat this monster,

179
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,880
you must cut off
the pincers, head, and legs.

180
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,390
The tail will upset your stomach.

181
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,350
The book said it'd be fine.

182
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,390
Or rather it just tastes bad.

183
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,140
Also, cut up the body as well.

184
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,400
It'll cook through more easily,
and the juices create a delicious broth.

185
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,400
It's easier to eat too.

186
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,900
And take out the internal organs.

187
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,900
They're bitter and have an awful texture.

188
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,450
As for the Walking Mushroom,

189
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,490
throw out the bottom
and three centimeters from the surface.

190
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,540
The feet are tasty, so keep those.

191
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,410
The feet are tasty?

192
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,620
Yeah, they have
a nice, unique smell, right?

193
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,290
<i>The smell of the feet, huh?</i>

194
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,540
This pot is too small.

195
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,500
Let's use mine.

196
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,050
You sure are prepared.

197
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,890
It feels like it's missing something.

198
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,600
Here.

199
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,520
Wait, there's no way I'll eat that.

200
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,310
- Marcille?
- Not in a million years.

201
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,940
This is a cemetery, you know.

202
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,940
Even if I'm okay with monsters,

203
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,200
plants with roots are out of the question.

204
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,660
Doesn't it look
good enough with just this?

205
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,870
- Marcille!
- And who the hell are you?

206
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,490
- Look up!
- What?

207
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,420
A Slime!

208
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,920
<i>Dammit, it's covering my face.</i>

209
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,920
<i>Oh no, I can't cast any spells.</i>

210
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,930
<i>Thinking back,
my first death was to a Slime.</i>

211
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,020
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,640
It got in my nose, though.

213
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,060
Blow it out.

214
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,270
You got rid of a Slime with just a knife?

215
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,820
It's simple if you know its composition.

216
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,110
They may look amorphous,

217
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,910
but their composition is actually
more structured than humans.

218
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,790
This is the inside of a Slime.

219
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,410
Compared to humans,
the stomach is flipped

220
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,080
and covers its internal organs and head
with digestive fluids.

221
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,960
It senses the breathing of its prey
and springs into action.

222
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:41,720
So you're an easier target
if you shout in a loud voice.

223
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,260
It's not edible like this,

224
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,060
but you can add citrus juice,
and wash it thoroughly in hot water.

225
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,770
Then, wipe off the moisture

226
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,480
or rub it in salt and dry it in the sun.

227
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,480
This makes a delicious delicacy.

228
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,030
If possible, it's best to
let it fast for two weeks.

229
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,490
Drying it takes time too.

230
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,990
This is a portable Slime drying net
that I made myself.

231
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,990
Sandwich it like this

232
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,540
and it dries as you walk around.

233
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,210
It takes time until it's ready,

234
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,620
but here's the final product.

235
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,130
Let's add this for today.

236
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,510
- But isn't it a delicacy?
- It's fine.

237
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,720
I've researched monster food
in this dungeon for over ten years.

238
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,270
Nothing makes me happier than to hear
someone is interested in Monster cuisine.

239
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,640
Ten years?

240
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,270
Was the dungeon here that long?

241
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,520
Well, sit tight.

242
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,500
It's ready.

243
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,290
HUGE SCORPION
AND WALKING MUSHROOM HOT POT

244
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,630
Boiled Huge Scorpions turn red, huh?

245
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,090
It feels so different seeing it in person.

246
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,180
It smells kind of delicious.

247
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,020
The meat contracts when cooked,

248
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,810
so it comes apart easily.

249
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,810
You're right.

250
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,820
This is delicious!

251
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,940
Isn't it?

252
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,320
It tastes so different
based on how you cook it.

253
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,360
Right?

254
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,320
It's so good! I'm shocked!

255
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,330
Right?!

256
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,580
Give me some too.

257
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,710
What is this?

258
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,050
Dried Slime innards.

259
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,340
It's good!

260
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,470
So, this is how you eat Slimes?

261
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,390
It also tastes good soaked in fruit juice.

262
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,430
And these tree roots
are so nice and fluffy.

263
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,270
They're not technically roots.

264
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,610
They're tree trunks
that grow upside down in the dungeon.

265
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,110
This algae is so soft and tasty.

266
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,820
Does this grow in the dungeon too?

267
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,240
That's just normal algae
that grows in humid places.

268
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,240
I can't believe all this is from
the dungeon we've been walking through.

269
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,130
I'm stuffed.

270
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,840
We still haven't heard your name.

271
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,420
My name is Senshi.

272
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,840
It means "researcher" in Dwarvish.

273
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm Laios.

274
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,760
That's Marcille the magic-user
and Chilchuck the picklock.

275
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,850
Looks like you're on a mission.

276
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,390
Yes, that's right.

277
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,600
One of our companions got eaten
by a monster in the lower levels.

278
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,270
We want to save her
before she gets digested.

279
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,150
By a monster? What kind?

280
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,990
A dragon with deep-red scales.

281
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,120
Deep-red scales?

282
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,160
The Red Dragon?

283
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,870
<i>To maintain their large bodies,</i>

284
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,790
<i>dragons spend most of their days sleeping.</i>

285
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,920
They also digest
much more slowly than other monsters.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,170
I hope so.

287
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,670
Please.

288
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,800
Would you allow me to accompany you?

289
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,680
You're more than welcome to.

290
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,180
It'd be a huge help to us as well.

291
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,680
Really?

292
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,430
- Thank you.
- Likewise.

293
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,440
I've dreamt of cooking
the Red Dragon for many years.

294
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,480
The Red Dragon.

295
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,690
Maybe I should go for the traditional
steak, or perhaps a burger.

296
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,950
Shabu-shabu is great too.

297
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,450
No, if I have eggs,
a Dragon and Egg bowl would be good.

298
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,210
<i>Is it okay to eat that?</i>

299
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,500
<i>It was on everyone's mind,
but no one said a word.</i>

300
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,970
<i>Second basement floor.</i>

301
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,470
<i>Unlike the cemetery
on the first basement floor,</i>

302
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,470
<i>an abnormal view spreads out before them.</i>

303
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,310
<i>According to academics,</i>

304
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,980
<i>this is the spire of the Golden Castle,
which is located deep underground.</i>

305
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,690
I've always wondered about this,

306
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,990
but how do those trees
not go above ground at this height?

307
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,570
Well, a curse made this dungeon.

308
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,490
Marcille, are you okay?

309
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,450
I tripped on a gap in the bridge.

310
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,000
We've walked quite a way.

311
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,580
You must be tired.

312
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,670
Let's find a campsite
and stop early for today.

313
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,630
We spent a night
in a hollow tree here before, didn't we?

314
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,760
Yeah, we did.

315
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,260
I burned myself trying to make pork soup.

316
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,180
Soup...

317
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,890
Are you hungry?

318
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,020
I have some scorpion broth
from lunch today.

319
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,270
I don't want it.

320
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,940
Well, then.

321
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
Let's go hunt a monster for dinner.

322
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,020
Jeez.

323
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,150
- What're you in the mood for?
- What?

324
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,280
I'll do my best to match your request.

325
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,160
You say that, but...

326
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,200
We're eating monsters, right?

327
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,170
Ugh, I'm fine with anything
as long as it's edible.

328
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,040
What kind of monsters live around here?

329
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,050
Let's see...

330
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,550
Big Bats and Giant Rats.

331
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,680
I don't want anything unsanitary.

332
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,680
Forest Goblins.

333
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,300
Demi-humans are a no-go.

334
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,430
Living Armor.

335
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,470
Metal?

336
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,310
Isn't there anything more normal,
like birds or tree fruits?

337
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,940
There's always that one person

338
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,980
who shoots down every idea
after agreeing to eat anything.

339
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,320
I don't think I'm asking for much.

340
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,570
There are normal monsters,
but those don't attack humans,

341
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,320
so they'll require more preparation.

342
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,040
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

343
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,080
Sorry, that's true.

344
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,210
But you know,

345
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,670
we might run into a monster
holding a flesh-eating lunch.

346
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,090
Let's try to enjoy this!

347
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,460
Not very optimistic about this.

348
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,470
Well, there are lots of fruits
during this season.

349
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,470
Really?

350
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,470
Yeah.

351
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,480
See? I knew it'd be tree fruit
from Man-eating Plants.

352
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Marcille, that's incorrect.

353
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,480
Man-eating Plants
are just the common name.

354
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,980
That flower, for example, is a Baraselia.

355
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,490
It mainly grows on monster trails

356
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,610
shooting out a mucus
reminiscent of spider webs.

357
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,240
When a creature touches the mucus,
it reflexively pulls them in.

358
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,750
It wraps around things that move,
but it doesn't digest them.

359
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,710
It makes them into compost.

360
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,750
But it sometimes
uses humans for nutrients, right?

361
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,460
The vegetables you usually eat

362
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,130
can be traced back to
dead remains and animal dung.

363
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,760
I can't fault that logic, but...

364
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,140
It's fine.

365
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,970
It's still only the second basement floor.

366
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,690
Someone would notice
if a corpse rolled by here.

367
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,230
They have people to retrieve corpses,

368
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,230
and no one would get eaten
by a monster in a place like this.

369
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,400
You think so?

370
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,740
I don't think we can pluck them in secret.

371
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,660
We'll have to fight.

372
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,620
Move over.

373
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,960
I'll get rid of them in one shot.

374
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,460
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,420
<i>Alamandras Proju.</i>

376
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,550
<i>Nexant Aslam.</i>

377
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,170
Stop, you moron!

378
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,840
Why?

379
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,720
Do you want the fruit
to get hit by your magic too?

380
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,230
Only take as much as you'll eat.
This rule is absolute.

381
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,610
This isn't the time for that!

382
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,480
No, let go of me!

383
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,700
They can't digest people?

384
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,620
But they're totally eating them!

385
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,700
What? Some of them
can digest things, though.

386
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,250
Depends on the plant type.

387
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,960
The one that has a hold of you

388
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,250
is a parasite type
that plants seeds inside your skin.

389
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,130
That's the worst kind!

390
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,760
Try to stay still, Marcille.

391
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
Plant-based monsters
basically have several limbs.

392
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,140
It'll take forever to fight them
one at a time.

393
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,560
For swords, there's only
one sure-fire spot.

394
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,520
The root.

395
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,900
Ouch...

396
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,730
Are you okay?

397
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,900
Yeah, thanks Laios.

398
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,280
- How was it?
- What?

399
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,200
This is Shadowtail, a plant-based parasite
that buries seeds

400
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,780
inside the skin of living creatures.

401
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,910
Unlike the Baraselia,
which is strong enough to break bones,

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,870
the Shadowtail needs to capture
its prey without killing them.

403
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,290
It uses a delicate balance,

404
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,300
immobilizing its prey
without making it uncomfortable.

405
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,800
I feel like it'd feel really good.
How did you feel?

406
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,930
I made her mad again.

407
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,810
Even I thought you were a bit much.

408
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,950
First, steam it lightly.

409
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,950
Cut around the stem in a circle.

410
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,290
Twist it a bit
and pull to get the seeds out.

411
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,710
- Wow.
- Peel the skin off,

412
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,210
beat the skin to make it soft,

413
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,960
and cover the pan with it.

414
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,300
Grind up the unripe fruit,
adding Slime and some scorpion broth,

415
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,470
mixing until it thickens.

416
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,680
Once it gets smooth,
add the rest of the scorpion broth

417
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,390
and chunks of tree fruit.

418
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,480
Mix it a bit
and pour it into the frying pan.

419
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,350
Cook it a bit.

420
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,730
I want to see if we can grow it
on the surface.

421
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,230
Of course, we can't.

422
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,820
No!

423
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,740
When it starts bubbling,
add the rest of the fruit.

424
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,240
All right.

425
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,120
It's done.

426
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,250
MAN-EATING PLANTS FRUIT TART

427
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,660
A tart?

428
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,250
At least, it looks like it.

429
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,290
The crust is just a non-stick coating.
You can leave it.

430
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,470
It's salt-flavored.
That's not what I expected.

431
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,010
Yeah, it's good.

432
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,970
Try it, Marcille. You'll probably like it.

433
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,680
None of the plants that ate people
are in it, right?

434
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,100
No, if we used
the gelatin from those plants,

435
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,730
it would've turned out even better.

436
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,780
The Slime didn't solidify well.

437
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,280
This is delicious.

438
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,120
The compost-type plants' fruit
is fresh and sweet.

439
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,290
The digestion-type plants'
is more compact and rich.

440
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,750
But I wonder if that's okay.

441
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,790
Doesn't that mean
they get eaten by other animals?

442
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,710
All this fruit they make gets taken away.

443
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,470
That's how a carnivorous plant works.

444
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,470
They use them to capture prey
for nourishment.

445
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,680
Oh, I see.

446
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,430
I wonder if this sweetness
is one of their tricks then.

447
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,520
Now I get it.

448
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,020
I'm so happy you're getting interested.

449
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,190
Stop that!

450
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,410
What'll we do with that corpse?

451
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,700
We don't have time
to go back to town.

452
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,460
Want me to revive it with magic?

453
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,670
No, there's a chance it won't work.

454
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,010
Maybe someone will take it
if we leave it in the open.

455
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,220
Yeah.

456
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,090
Let's make it visible.

457
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,220
I've seen this at execution sites.

458
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,560
<i>Marcille had a nightmare that night.</i>

459
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,650
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

460
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,570
<i>Eat or be eaten.</i>

461
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,400
<i>There is no hierarchy.</i>

462
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,820
<i>Eating is a privilege for those who live.</i>

463
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,990
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

464
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,490
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

465
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,006
