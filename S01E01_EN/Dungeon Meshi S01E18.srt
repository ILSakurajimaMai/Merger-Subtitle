1
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:23,726
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,340
We had such a tough time
finding those stairs up,

3
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:39,176
but as soon as we decide
to move forward, we find this.

4
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,678
It makes me feel queasy.

5
00:01:41,178 --> 00:01:42,680
It's still wet.

6
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:46,726
Falin must've passed through here
not too long ago and made her way down.

7
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,645
It must've been a tight squeeze.

8
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,189
<i>The sixth floor</i>

9
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:56,360
<i>consists of canals
made from tunnels dug by ancient dwarves.</i>

10
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:58,779
<i>Endlessly vast and long,</i>

11
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:02,116
<i>they crisscross under the city like veins.</i>

12
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:06,454
<i>Many things must have flowed
through here over the years.</i>

13
00:02:06,537 --> 00:02:10,124
<i>Water, of course,
but also people, animals,</i>

14
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:12,418
<i>conspiracies, lies, and rumors.</i>

15
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,295
<i>Money and blood.</i>

16
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,380
I-It's chilly!

17
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:19,633
The sixth floor is
supposed to be hot and humid.

18
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:22,386
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

19
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,139
No, I recognize this route.

20
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:28,809
<i>This is definitely the floor
where the Red Dragon attacked us</i>

21
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:30,144
<i>and almost wiped us out.</i>

22
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:33,939
The walls and paths
shift around in this dungeon.

23
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:36,150
So it's not surprising
if the temperature changes, too.

24
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:39,028
Better cold than hot,

25
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,656
but it's hard to follow the blood trail
under all this snow and water.

26
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,535
Why don't we head back
to where we got nearly wiped out?

27
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,245
If the Cleaners
haven't gotten to them yet,

28
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:50,664
maybe we can retrieve
the stuff we left behind.

29
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:52,917
I hope Falin's okay.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,753
This cold must be rough for a Red Dragon.

31
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:57,922
Oh, is that why she had feathers?

32
00:02:58,005 --> 00:02:59,256
So what's the plan?

33
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,841
After bluffing and telling Shuro

34
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:03,260
that you're going
to take down the lunatic magician,

35
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:05,429
you do have something in mind, right?

36
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:07,306
About that...

37
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,643
<i>Falin was looking
for someone named Delgal.</i>

38
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,730
<i>It was an order given to the Red Dragon
by the lunatic magician.</i>

39
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:20,653
<i>That's also why the Dragon was
sleeplessly roaming on a different floor.</i>

40
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,947
Delgal?

41
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,532
Who was that again?

42
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:25,991
The name sounds familiar.

43
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:26,909
He was a king.

44
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:31,413
Delgal was the last king
of the Golden City

45
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:32,832
that fell a millennium ago.

46
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:37,628
<i>There are inscriptions praising him
all over this dungeon.</i>

47
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:38,963
<i>That's it!</i>

48
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:40,881
<i>His name is on excavated stuff as well.</i>

49
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:42,091
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,801
Didn't Delgal...

51
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:44,885
Yeah.

52
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:47,263
<i>When this dungeon was discovered,</i>

53
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:50,891
<i>he appeared on the surface,
turned to dust, and disappeared.</i>

54
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:53,102
So, this lunatic magician

55
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:56,856
has been commanding a Red Dragon
and reconstructing the dungeon,

56
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,108
all to find a king who vanished ages ago?

57
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:02,903
The lunatic magician saw the previous king
get killed before his eyes.

58
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:06,031
Since then, he's been afraid Delgal,
the king's son, will meet the same fate.

59
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:09,785
{\an8}That's why he thought
we were assassins and attacked us.

60
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:12,913
{\an8}Huh? Who told you that?

61
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:13,914
{\an8}Did you make that up?

62
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:16,167
No, actually,

63
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,920
<i>I bumped into the lunatic magician
in those Living Paintings.</i>

64
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:21,005
<i>That's how I found out.</i>

65
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:24,049
Remember when I mentioned
someone getting mad at me

66
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,843
after I had some food in those paintings?

67
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,386
You what?!

68
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:28,637
You should've said sooner!

69
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,639
I didn't recognize him at the time!

70
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:32,933
I see.

71
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:34,768
So you relived the past.

72
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:39,106
Just to confirm,
the lunatic magician is an elf, right?

73
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,525
Can elves really live for a millennium?

74
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:44,486
There are records of that
in the distant past,

75
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,364
but now, elves can only
live up to 500 years at most.

76
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,949
Only, huh?

77
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,660
Well, if he can control
the lives of others at will,

78
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:54,955
it must be a piece of cake
for him to prolong his own life.

79
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:56,248
Impossible!

80
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:58,959
Extending your own lifespan
with your own magic

81
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:01,962
is like eating yourself to live longer.

82
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:02,922
Anyway,

83
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:04,381
if he mistook us as the king's foe,

84
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:05,966
and attacked us...

85
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,469
Maybe we can clear up
his misunderstanding by talking to him.

86
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,393
The wind is getting stronger.

87
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:17,728
It's freezing!

88
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:19,521
<i>I can't see ahead.</i>

89
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:20,773
Can you hear me?

90
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:21,982
Are you guys still with me?!

91
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,484
Where are you, Laios?!

92
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,110
I can't see a thing!

93
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,488
We can't afford to get separated here!

94
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,156
Everyone, hold hands!

95
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,043
<i>We can't go on like this.</i>

96
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:44,129
There's a tunnel!

97
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,673
Let's take shelter!

98
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,100
Is everyone here?

99
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:57,101
Chil?

100
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,018
Here.

101
00:05:58,102 --> 00:05:58,936
I'm good.

102
00:05:59,645 --> 00:06:00,521
Marcille?

103
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:01,647
Uh-huh.

104
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,606
I'm here.

105
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:04,024
Senshi?

106
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:04,942
Yeah.

107
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:05,859
I'm fine.

108
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:07,319
That's a relief.

109
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:08,237
Huh?

110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,698
- Marcille, lights, please?
- Hm? What was that?

111
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:21,166
This place feels like
it used to be a prison.

112
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,003
Anyway, for a moment I was worried that--

113
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:27,172
- Huh?
- Huh?

114
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,424
- No way!
- No way!

115
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:29,675
- Huh?
- Huh?

116
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:31,427
- What's this?
- What's this?

117
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,971
<i>There's more of us!</i>

118
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:36,557
Dammit! What's going on?

119
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,183
Is this illusion magic?

120
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:39,810
No.

121
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:45,190
I think these are Shapeshifters.

122
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:46,608
Shape-what?

123
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:47,651
Don't you know them?

124
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:50,571
They're monsters that pop up
back in my hometown from time to time.

125
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:54,033
<i>When trekking through the hills
or fields in a thick fog or blizzard,</i>

126
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:57,369
<i>you suddenly notice your crew
or family have multiplied.</i>

127
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:01,874
But they're Shapeshifters pretending
to be them and blending in.

128
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:04,335
Your hometown sounds
like a dangerous place.

129
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:06,045
Are they a kind of fairy?

130
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,713
Do they work mischief?

131
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:11,091
If you don't catch on, they'll devour
the original and take their place.

132
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:12,134
What?!

133
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:14,094
We have to sniff out the imposters now!

134
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:17,514
I must eat.

135
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:19,350
What a pickle.

136
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,102
Say, the Laioses over there...

137
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:24,355
It's obvious they're imposters.

138
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:25,773
True.

139
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:28,859
They don't seem to know
much about monsters.

140
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:31,820
They say Shapeshifters
can read the minds of creatures

141
00:07:31,904 --> 00:07:34,615
and mimic the looks
of those they're close to.

142
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,283
The three versions of me over there

143
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,828
are probably how I appear
in your memories.

144
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:41,872
True.

145
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:43,248
If you look carefully,

146
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:46,293
they all look a little different.

147
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,755
Well then, can you start
by dealing with her?

148
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:50,672
What?

149
00:07:50,756 --> 00:07:52,091
She's clearly an imposter.

150
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:53,550
True.

151
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:54,885
You've got it all wrong!

152
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:56,261
Take a closer look!

153
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:58,347
- I'll use magic! Black magic!
- So annoying.

154
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,890
Whose memory is that?

155
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:02,684
Those two are clearly imposters, too.

156
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:04,353
How come?

157
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:05,270
Huh?

158
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,355
Look closely!

159
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:08,899
My scarf isn't a muffler.

160
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:11,026
And Senshi's helmet is missing its notch.

161
00:08:12,945 --> 00:08:14,113
Now that you mention it...

162
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:18,242
Those two must be
straight out of Laios' memories.

163
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:20,035
His memory of us is too vague.

164
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,832
Is it okay to just leave them?

165
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:27,793
They aren't as intelligent as humans.

166
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:30,921
{\an8}But if we hurt them,
they'll put up a fight.

167
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:35,050
{\an8}And I'd rather not fight
unknown monsters in this situation.

168
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:38,804
{\an8}Let's unmask these phonies peacefully
and deal with them all at once!

169
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,350
It's great that he's enthusiastic, but...

170
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:46,770
Can he really spot the imposters?

171
00:08:46,854 --> 00:08:48,313
I'm not too sure.

172
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:51,817
<i>There are still six imposters left.</i>

173
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,362
<i>When they're all lined up,
the differences are pretty clear.</i>

174
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:59,116
<i>But even as we do this,
our foggy memories are getting corrected.</i>

175
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,410
<i>We need to get to the bottom of this fast.</i>

176
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:05,122
Each Marcille has a different hairstyle.

177
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:08,250
I can't recall how her hair was
last time I saw her.

178
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,209
- You can't?
- You can't?

179
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:12,004
This style is pretty unique,
so you must remember!

180
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:12,921
Come on!

181
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:15,340
It was freezing in that blizzard,
so I had it down.

182
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:18,093
The texture of their hair is totally off.

183
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:20,012
Hair is really important for a mage.

184
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:23,140
They're all saying stuff
that sounds just like her.

185
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:26,310
Well, they're the images
we've got of her, after all.

186
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:30,814
I've got it!

187
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:34,234
We can tell by asking for information
only the real me would know!

188
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:37,029
{\an8}Don't go asking them to guess
your mom's maiden name.

189
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:38,113
{\an8}Not that.

190
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:41,408
The book of magic!

191
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,119
{\an8}See?

192
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:47,331
{\an8}One is obviously fake.

193
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,792
But the other two seem legit.

194
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:52,211
What? Oh, come on!

195
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:53,962
Her incantation grammar is all messed up!

196
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,380
That's what I was going to say!

197
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:59,801
Our stuff should help us
spot the fakes a bit.

198
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:01,720
Senshi, show us your gear.

199
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:08,352
Take those three away!

200
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,526
<i>We've managed
to narrow it down to two each,</i>

201
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:17,903
<i>but now we're stuck again.</i>

202
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,949
<i>We've got three more imposters to find.</i>

203
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,411
All right. Let's have a meal.

204
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,288
- In this situation?
- In this situation?

205
00:10:28,872 --> 00:10:31,208
We can't rely on appearances anymore
to spot them.

206
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,044
We'll have to judge
based on their behavior.

207
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:37,548
Everyone will cook
and I'll be watching closely.

208
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,300
That's how I'll spot the imposters.

209
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:45,305
<i>He didn't realize
he'd run into the lunatic magician</i>

210
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,057
<i>or pick up on Shuro's feelings.</i>

211
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,602
<i>He couldn't even remember
where he'd met Kabru before.</i>

212
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:54,064
<i>Are we really relying
on Laios' observation skills here?</i>

213
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,318
<i>- I'm worried.
- I'm worried.</i>

214
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:02,823
<i>I've got to figure out which
of my companions are monster imposters.</i>

215
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:05,242
<i>It's a chance to earn back
the trust I've lost.</i>

216
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,369
<i>I don't want to let
my friends down any further.</i>

217
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:10,998
<i>I must pick up
on those subtle differences!</i>

218
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:13,208
This is Laios we're talking about.

219
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:17,713
He might find the monster imposters
more appealing.

220
00:11:17,796 --> 00:11:19,131
- That's possible.
- That's possible.

221
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:22,467
{\an8}<i>-We've got to do something on our own!
- We've got to do something on our own!</i>

222
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,052
{\an8}I'll be keeping an eye on things.

223
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,054
{\an8}Good luck to you all.

224
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:27,347
{\an8}So annoying.

225
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,515
{\an8}What are we cooking?

226
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:31,184
<i>We've got those things
I found on the fifth floor</i>

227
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:34,396
<i>and those provisions from Lady Maizuru.</i>

228
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:39,276
<i>We've got the perfect ingredients to make...</i>

229
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,861
And one more thing.

230
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:44,781
I want each of you to cook a dish
in pairs with your counterpart.

231
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:46,033
- What?
- What?

232
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:50,162
I'll be observing the differences
in behavior as you work together.

233
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,456
You can get the recipe from Senshi.

234
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:54,541
So, everyone,

235
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,293
are you ready?

236
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:58,003
Start cooking!

237
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:01,506
<i>First, the Chilchuck team.</i>

238
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:03,759
<i>Cut the meat.</i>

239
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:05,886
<i>Mix the egg and seasoning together.</i>

240
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:08,430
<i>Chilchuck A sat
in the middle of the corridor,</i>

241
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:12,351
<i>while Chilchuck B sat on top
of a wooden box before getting to work.</i>

242
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:13,852
What are you writing?

243
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:15,062
You're making this awkward!

244
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,735
This thing won't open.
Laios, give me a hand.

245
00:12:23,195 --> 00:12:24,154
He slipped up!

246
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:26,156
Did you see that? B's the imposter!

247
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,075
Huh? Why do you say that?

248
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:30,077
Don't you get it?

249
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,746
I've got my principles
and pride, you know.

250
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,290
People help each other out, Chilchuck.

251
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,959
I think you're being too cynical.

252
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:41,046
Now that I look closer,
A has a bad look in his eye.

253
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,214
Hey.

254
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:44,466
Our Chilchuck is cuter than that.

255
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:45,550
Quit it!

256
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:48,720
L-Laios, you can tell, can't you?

257
00:12:49,513 --> 00:12:50,972
<i>Chilchuck A...</i>

258
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:54,351
<i>He does have a mean expression.</i>

259
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,977
<i>Maybe he's the imposter.</i>

260
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:57,187
I'll think about it.

261
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,730
Keep cooking.

262
00:13:00,148 --> 00:13:01,274
Dolt.

263
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,985
He insulted me in the common language.

264
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:06,321
<i>Next, the Marcille team.</i>

265
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:09,699
I know it's a little late to ask,
but what egg is this?

266
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:11,159
It's a Harpy's egg.

267
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:14,538
I thought I said at the start,

268
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,373
no humanoid monsters!

269
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,751
I've been making compromises lately,
but this is taking it too far!

270
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,337
<i>Marcille B is business as usual.</i>

271
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:23,922
<i>Almost to the point of being extreme.</i>

272
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:25,006
<i>On the other hand...</i>

273
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:27,217
<i>Boil the chopped up Dryad.</i>

274
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,137
What do you think, Marcille A?

275
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,888
I'm not thrilled about it,

276
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:35,225
but I've eaten Fish-man eggs
and even Dryads before.

277
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,893
I wouldn't make a fuss about this now.

278
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:40,230
I'll do anything to save Falin.

279
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,691
Hey!

280
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:45,986
I'll do anything for Falin too!

281
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:48,280
Your determination is a bit lacking, B.

282
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:51,158
I mean, it's not like
eating a Harpy will fix anything!

283
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,744
<i>Once the Dryad is soft enough
for a chopstick to go through, drain them,</i>

284
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:57,247
<i>and mash them up with some seasoning.</i>

285
00:13:58,248 --> 00:14:00,584
<i>Hmm, this is tough.</i>

286
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,711
<i>They both sound like Marcille.</i>

287
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,671
<i>And finally, the Senshi team.</i>

288
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:07,549
Where did you find the Harpy eggs?

289
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:10,802
There was a nest in an old, rundown house.

290
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:13,013
I gathered all I could find there.

291
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:15,724
<i>Dice the meat into one-centimeter cubes.</i>

292
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:17,934
After all,

293
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:19,478
eggs have all the...

294
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:20,645
...nutrition you need.

295
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:25,817
<i>Sauté the ingredients with rice
over a low flame and add the seasoning.</i>

296
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:28,612
Rice was Shuro's favorite.

297
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:33,450
It's packed with nutrients
adventurers need.

298
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:35,827
We're lucky we got our hands on some.

299
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:39,539
<i>Unlike me, who's just eager
to try out monsters,</i>

300
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:41,833
<i>Senshi sees things a step deeper.</i>

301
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,920
<i>I can't match his attention
to flavor and nutrition.</i>

302
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,631
<i>All the dishes look delicious.</i>

303
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:50,258
<i>I can't spot the imposters
simply based on how efficient they are.</i>

304
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:55,472
{\an8}Um, nobody's mentioning it,
so I'm going to ask.

305
00:14:56,056 --> 00:14:59,559
Is it just me
or is Senshi B kind of good-looking?

306
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,233
He's always been like that.

307
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:08,068
Senshi's always been cool.

308
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:08,985
- Huh?
- Huh?

309
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:11,822
{\an8}Is this some stereotype about dwarves?

310
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:14,241
{\an8}Senshi doesn't look this dopey.

311
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,535
<i>Senshi is cool.</i>

312
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:24,668
The dishes are almost done,
but have you made up your mind yet?

313
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,878
<i>Honestly,</i>

314
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:28,588
<i>I'm stumped.</i>

315
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:31,466
<i>They all feel like
they could be both real and fake.</i>

316
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,178
<i>Asking me to spot the illusions
conjured up in our heads</i>

317
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,389
<i>is quite unfair to start with.</i>

318
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:41,351
<i>Hunting down monsters disguised
as humans might be interesting,</i>

319
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:43,270
<i>but we're dealing with illusions here.</i>

320
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:47,357
<i>Hunting down monsters?</i>

321
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,359
It's done!

322
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:51,278
MEMORIES OF THE FIFTH FLOOR PILAF

323
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:52,195
SWEET DRYAD

324
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,405
THE WHOLE FIFTH FLOOR PICCATA

325
00:15:53,488 --> 00:15:55,448
All right, everyone,
hear me out as we eat.

326
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:58,243
The ones I pegged as real are...

327
00:15:59,494 --> 00:16:00,662
Chilchuck A!

328
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,039
<i>The mean one with a bad look in his eyes!</i>

329
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:04,833
Marcille B!

330
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,169
<i>The one who wouldn't want to eat
a Harpy's egg even if it was for Falin!</i>

331
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,963
And Senshi A!

332
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:11,172
<i>The one who looks dopey!</i>

333
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,674
So,

334
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:15,260
please step into the cage, imposters.

335
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:16,928
- Wait a minute!
- Wait a minute!

336
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:19,222
Why do you think he's the real deal?

337
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,641
That one's obviously the imposter!

338
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:23,935
What made you think that?

339
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,271
Just a hunch.

340
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,732
Anyway, I'll explain later.

341
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:31,067
First, let's get rid of these imposters.

342
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:32,694
Ju...

343
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:34,195
Just a hunch?

344
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,739
Get rid of?

345
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:37,949
As I thought, he can't be counted on.

346
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:39,993
We have to watch our backs...

347
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:42,454
On our own.

348
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:48,793
<i>No matter who I picked,
this was inevitable.</i>

349
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:52,714
<i>A shapeshifter is a broad term
for monsters that mimic other beings.</i>

350
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:55,467
<i>Some mimic voices, possess others,</i>

351
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,011
<i>or even physically change forms.</i>

352
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:00,305
<i>This monster falls into
one of those categories.</i>

353
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,558
<i>There's no way monsters could cook.</i>

354
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,811
<i>They're likely creating illusions,
just as Marcille suggested.</i>

355
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,982
<i>Given that they target humans and animals,
they're probably carnivores or omnivores.</i>

356
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:14,819
<i>They're timid and lack the strength
to attack their prey head-on.</i>

357
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:18,073
<i>This place is cold, dark,
and visibility is poor.</i>

358
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:22,327
<i>They're a beast that can handle the cold
and relies on smell and hearing.</i>

359
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:26,957
<i>Downwind is that way.</i>

360
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,043
<i>Our enemy's probably
waiting for us to tire out.</i>

361
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:33,755
<i>Randomly swinging my sword won't cut it.</i>

362
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:35,799
<i>What should I do?</i>

363
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,760
<i>Kensuke's awfully quiet too.</i>

364
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:40,720
<i>Maybe it'll die in this cold.</i>

365
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:44,391
<i>To take down a beast,
you have to fight like one.</i>

366
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:47,602
<i>I'll turn the tables
and make the hunter the hunted.</i>

367
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:51,064
<i>It's been a while,
but I'll try that thing.</i>

368
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,462
A-A dog?

369
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:15,505
He's good!

370
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:17,257
No, that's a hunting dog!

371
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,011
{\an8}<i>I've lived with dogs
for as long as I can remember.</i>

372
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:22,762
{\an8}<i>They taught me all sorts of things.</i>

373
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:24,681
<i>How to hunt,</i>

374
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:27,767
<i>how to take down
something stronger than you.</i>

375
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:29,436
<i>Now, I'll teach you!</i>

376
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:32,105
He's good!

377
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:33,356
He's really good!

378
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,524
Just like a dog!

379
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,526
<i>You're not the hunter,</i>

380
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:38,611
<i>you're the prey!</i>

381
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:43,324
Everyone, look! The illusions!

382
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,465
<i>It's finally showing itself.</i>

383
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,885
<i>If you're a beast, you know the rules.</i>

384
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:03,011
<i>In this fight,</i>

385
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:08,850
<i>the one who flinches first is the loser!</i>

386
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:12,979
- Laios!
- Laios!

387
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:37,879
Are you alive, Laios?

388
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:39,089
I mean, are you sane?

389
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:41,216
Yeah.

390
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:43,301
{\an8}I've got a lot of things I want to say,

391
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,512
{\an8}but why didn't you draw your sword?

392
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,931
{\an8}I got a bit too carried away
in playing the part.

393
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:53,812
None of the dishes turned out.

394
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:56,272
They were made
with the illusions, after all.

395
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:57,607
Let's make them again.

396
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,276
Anyway,

397
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,571
turns out your intuition
was spot on, Laios.

398
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:05,365
What tipped you off?

399
00:20:06,324 --> 00:20:08,368
Maybe it was how you acted
when it came to monsters.

400
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:13,456
<i>First off, I noticed Chilchuck
was sitting on a wooden box.</i>

401
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,751
<i>Those are prime hiding spots
for Mimics and Tentacles.</i>

402
00:20:17,252 --> 00:20:20,255
<i>The fact he seemed totally unfazed by it
didn't sit right with me.</i>

403
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:23,633
There was a nest in an old, rundown house.

404
00:20:23,716 --> 00:20:25,885
I gathered all I could find there.

405
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:29,222
<i>Considering how much you care
about the ecosystem's balance,</i>

406
00:20:29,305 --> 00:20:30,890
<i>that remark seemed rather thoughtless.</i>

407
00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:33,893
I mean, it's not like
eating a Harpy will fix anything!

408
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:37,480
<i>Finally, the fact that Marcille
threw away the boiled water.</i>

409
00:20:37,564 --> 00:20:41,109
<i>If she were being cautious of an Undine,
that action seemed reckless.</i>

410
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:44,028
<i>And what bothered me
was her lack of concern about it.</i>

411
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,413
In this situation, her carelessness
felt more genuine to me.

412
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:55,290
I see.

413
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:57,125
{\an8}I'm impressed.

414
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,419
{\an8}I've got a higher opinion
of you now, Laios.

415
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:01,754
{\an8}Even if your viewpoint is a bit off.

416
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:03,840
But still,

417
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:06,509
seeing through illusions
is practically impossible.

418
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:09,679
This monster banked on that one trick
to survive, after all.

419
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:11,806
And here I thought...

420
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,475
I've eaten Fish-man eggs
and even Dryads before.

421
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,687
<i>You caught on because of that comment.</i>

422
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:22,525
I mean, we've never had
Fish-man eggs before.

423
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:23,484
Right?

424
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:30,241
<i>Were they in the porridge we had that day?</i>

425
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:34,704
The dessert is done as well.

426
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:35,872
- Yay!
- Yay!

427
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:38,374
It's been ages
since I've had something sweet.

428
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,876
How about some tea?

429
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,463
I'm pretty sure we had tea leaves
in the provisions we got.

430
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:47,008
{\an8}Maybe you misplaced it.

431
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:49,260
{\an8}No, I'm sure I placed it right here.

432
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,225
<i>The rice...</i>

433
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,492
No one's here.

434
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:18,957
Marcille!

435
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,751
Drop your weapons and stay still.

436
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:24,712
Let's talk this out peacefully.
