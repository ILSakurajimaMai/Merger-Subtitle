1
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,862
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:32,952
No way.

3
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:35,204
Falin...

4
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:38,374
C-Could she really be resurrected
from that condition?

5
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,043
It's not unprecedented, but...

6
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:45,214
H-Hey, Laios.

7
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:47,007
We don't know that yet.

8
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,759
I'll take her to the resurrection office.

9
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,303
Are you planning to take the entire mass?

10
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:53,889
There are probably Warg bones
in there as well.

11
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:55,808
I can't distinguish them, so...

12
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:58,519
I'll help.

13
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,064
Wait!

14
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:06,193
The bond between her soul and flesh
is very fragile right now.

15
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,778
Moving her remains is risky.

16
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,032
<i>The greater the damage to one's flesh,
the more likely their soul is to depart.</i>

17
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,743
<i>The main reason some resurrections fail</i>

18
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:18,789
<i>is the soul's departure
or the incomplete restoration of the body.</i>

19
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,083
So, what do we do?

20
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:25,045
Bring a revivifier
and resurrect her right here.

21
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:30,009
<i>But it requires twice the calories
of the damaged parts to restore her.</i>

22
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,637
<i>They'll need to bring a substantial amount
of fresh blood and flesh along.</i>

23
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,765
- They'll rot on their way here--
- No.

24
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,017
What?

25
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:38,934
Yes.

26
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:42,897
We have an abundance
of fresh blood and flesh right here.

27
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,399
W-Wait a minute!

28
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,192
Are you going to resurrect her?

29
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,319
Using dragon flesh?

30
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,946
But resurrection magic
isn't your specialty, is it?

31
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:55,326
I've been silent about it
because I didn't want to alarm you.

32
00:02:56,702 --> 00:03:01,540
But I specialize in the study
of ancient magic that's forbidden now.

33
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:04,919
I think using that
is the only way we can bring her back.

34
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,421
It's not honest magic, but still.

35
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,298
- What?
- Black magic?

36
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,175
Don't. No good will come of it.

37
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:13,719
There is no good or evil in magic.

38
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,057
What do you say, Laios?

39
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,976
Do it, Marcille.

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,520
Bring Falin back to life.

41
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:26,774
Leave it to me.

42
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:27,983
I'll try my best.

43
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,610
Are you all out of your minds?

44
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,987
You're seriously going
to use dragon flesh?

45
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:34,657
Usually, they use goats or pigs.

46
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:36,575
It's kinda late
to start having qualms about it.

47
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:37,493
Marcille.

48
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,761
Her body should be as close
to its original state as possible,

49
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,888
so I'll start by reconstructing
her bone structure.

50
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,431
I see.

51
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:01,642
I have some knowledge
of a dog's skeletal framework.

52
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:04,520
I'll work on putting together
a Warg's frame.

53
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,400
That's not necessary, is it?

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,361
It could help avoid oversights or errors!

55
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,324
Humans typically have around 200 bones.

56
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,828
So, that means
there are roughly 840 bones here.

57
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,496
Huh? That many?

58
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,624
Based on the skulls, there were two Wargs.

59
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:28,377
A dog's body has around 320 bones.

60
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,422
It should be easier
if we begin with the simpler bones.

61
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:34,383
The more rounded one is a human rib cage.

62
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:37,594
Next, the vertebrae
that connect with the ribs.

63
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:40,681
This is easy as well since the curvature
of the spine is so distinct.

64
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:44,309
The tricky part
is the smaller bones of the arms and legs.

65
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,271
I can't distinguish them at all.

66
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,691
Let's start sorting them out,
beginning with the prominent ones.

67
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:54,069
The largest bone here is the ankle bone.

68
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,698
Arrange the other large bones
in a way that fits,

69
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,284
and we have the instep of a foot.

70
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,746
Lastly, the bones of the hand.

71
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,956
Let's start by arranging the fingers.

72
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:07,291
I got it!

73
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,210
Like this, right?

74
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:11,879
Close!

75
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:15,090
The longest metacarpal isn't
in the middle finger

76
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,467
but in the index finger.

77
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,304
Finally, we need to find the carpal bones
that connect the fingers to her arm.

78
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,935
Give me a hint!

79
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:28,729
You better not be enjoying this!

80
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,484
There.

81
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,027
It's done!

82
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:37,488
THE BONE STRUCTURES
OF FALIN AND WARGS

83
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,740
I don't know how to put it, but...

84
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,493
they're such beautiful
skeletal frameworks.

85
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:44,411
They're really nice skeletons now.

86
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,705
It seems they had good calcium.

87
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:50,000
This won't revive
the Wargs as well, will it?

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,170
The only souls confined
to the dungeon are those of humans.

89
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,049
Otherwise, this place would be crowded
with the souls of all sorts of creatures.

90
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:10,354
Well then, I'll start.

91
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:13,774
<i>O Pilitsham.</i>

92
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,819
<i>O Esdoms. O Villaru.</i>

93
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:20,405
<i>Casuszameo Rotokt Artumcuks.</i>

94
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,283
<i>O Kunquikeo. Eoktum Kome.</i>

95
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:30,290
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.
Aoewauk Aentujon.</i>

96
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,252
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.</i>

97
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:35,879
<i>Aoewauk Aentujon.</i>

98
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,049
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.</i>

99
00:06:39,716 --> 00:06:43,303
<i>Aoewauk Aentujon...</i>

100
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,722
Marcille!

101
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,935
She's unconscious.

102
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,562
What happened?

103
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:53,188
Did it work?

104
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:13,000
Falin!

105
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,794
Her air passage is blocked with blood.

106
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,838
Try to stay calm and spit it out.

107
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,632
You're safe now.

108
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:26,305
Falin.

109
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:37,566
Laios...

110
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:43,155
Thank goodness.

111
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,159
Cold...

112
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,369
Right, my armor!

113
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,622
Sorry! I'll get you something to wear!

114
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:56,126
Falin, are you okay?

115
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,629
Are you unhurt?

116
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,715
That's good.

117
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:03,217
Marcille.

118
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:04,968
Marcille!

119
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,180
What happened to Falin?

120
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,098
She's come back to life.

121
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:13,227
She still seems a bit disoriented, though.

122
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,900
Falin!

123
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:25,072
Thank goodness!

124
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,199
I'm so relieved!

125
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:29,660
Marcille...

126
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,502
Chil...

127
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:40,003
How's she doing?

128
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,257
She still seems to be a little confused.

129
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,384
Right. Let me introduce him.

130
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:47,010
This is Senshi.

131
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,263
He helped us a lot on our journey.

132
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,974
Hello, Falin.

133
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,600
It's nice to meet you.

134
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:55,978
Sen...

135
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,904
Let's start preparing our meal!

136
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,703
Thank goodness!

137
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,039
I'm so relieved!

138
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,833
M-Marcille.

139
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,335
I can wash myself, you know.

140
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:23,589
I had to make sure your skin
was restored properly.

141
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,591
It tickles!

142
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:31,972
You have a bruise here!

143
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,182
T-That's from when I tripped

144
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,602
and bumped my chin
on the edge of the steps as a kid.

145
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:38,604
Oh.

146
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,691
Marcille, you look paler than me.

147
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm just running low on magic.

148
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,572
I'll be fine if I have something to eat
and rest a little...

149
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:54,369
What are you doing?

150
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:58,623
I just wanted to share
some of my magic with you.

151
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:00,584
Oh, please.

152
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:03,628
You don't have enough magic
right now to share.

153
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:04,630
But I do.

154
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,132
I'm feeling surprisingly great.

155
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,217
There's this power welling up inside me.

156
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:13,221
But it's a bit like
recovering from an illness,

157
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,183
so hold off on using magic
until you're back on your feet, okay?

158
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:21,563
I died, didn't I?

159
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:26,443
I can't remember how it happened.

160
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:28,612
What exactly happened?

161
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:30,322
Everyone is exhausted and scarred.

162
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:33,283
And why is the Red Dragon here?

163
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,744
Are Namari and Shuro safe?

164
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:39,790
If everyone had to push themselves
because of me, then...

165
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,375
That's not...

166
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,044
And what's up with that magic circle?

167
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:48,757
It didn't look like anything good.

168
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:55,097
If I forced you
to use something like that...

169
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,308
It's fine!

170
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:03,939
Sure, getting here was challenging,
and I had some rough times.

171
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:06,566
But now, they're all just
stories to laugh about

172
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,819
because everything worked out!

173
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:12,823
So, don't worry about it.

174
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,159
None of us has any regrets at all.

175
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:26,336
We can erase that magic circle altogether,
and it will be fine.

176
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:29,214
For now...

177
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:33,260
our main concern is the journey back.

178
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:35,637
What should we do about your clothes?

179
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:38,098
And I have to wash and dry mine.

180
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,976
Honestly, if it weren't for those frogs...

181
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:42,477
Frogs?

182
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,480
What's the plan now?

183
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:47,983
Head back to the surface.

184
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,736
We can't use return magic
or the Orcs' secret passage anymore.

185
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:54,156
We'll have to take the main road
back to the castle.

186
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:55,240
That's not what I meant.

187
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:59,995
Even though you've rescued your sister,
you're still penniless.

188
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,914
I do have some savings in the bank.

189
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:04,833
But you don't have a token, right?

190
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,294
And to get it reissued,
it'll take a month.

191
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,379
That's the predicament.

192
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,716
Anyway, Marcille, that girl!

193
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,217
Did you know, Laios?

194
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,178
That she could use black magic?

195
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:18,847
She never shared many details,

196
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:22,267
but she mentioned wanting
to explore the dungeon for her studies.

197
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:24,019
I thought it was odd.

198
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:28,523
Why would an elf who doesn't seem
to be desperate venture into the dungeon?

199
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:31,026
She's not one of those dark elves, is she?

200
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,862
I hope this won't lead to any trouble.

201
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:37,908
Who are you calling a dark elf?

202
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,162
I-I mean, if it was harmless,
it wouldn't be forbidden, right?

203
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,413
Harmless?

204
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,916
Even recovery magic
can be used for torture.

205
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,960
Just like a blade,
it depends on how you use it.

206
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,422
I study forbidden arts to benefit people.

207
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,175
I have nothing to feel guilty about.

208
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,095
But concerning the method
of resurrection I used,

209
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:01,598
it's best for all of us
to forget about it.

210
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:03,433
So you do feel guilty about it!

211
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,436
Oh, well. Never mind.

212
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:08,146
It's all in the past now.

213
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,440
By the way...

214
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,948
<i>Where's Senshi?</i>

215
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:19,824
Preparing the dragon meat, I imagine.

216
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:24,871
I just passed Mr. Senshi
carrying a pot and some firewood.

217
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,039
What did I tell you?

218
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,332
He's getting ready to cook.

219
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,709
Cook...

220
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:31,461
Near the dragon?

221
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,215
- This is bad!
- This is bad!

222
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,675
What's wrong?

223
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:39,010
When we opened up the dragon,
we opened its fuel bag, too.

224
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,304
If he starts a fire there now...

225
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:44,349
Senshi!

226
00:13:44,349 --> 00:13:45,725
Stop!

227
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,978
Senshi!

228
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,162
W-We're alive.

229
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,665
Is this defense magic?

230
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,422
Falin, did you do this?

231
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,173
It seems so.

232
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,258
In that split second?

233
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,426
Without chanting?

234
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,428
I don't know.

235
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,931
I just felt I had to protect everyone and...

236
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,434
That's amazing.

237
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,145
Kind of like an adrenaline rush, huh?

238
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:33,273
If only we had that power
during the fight with the Red Dragon.

239
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,193
A-Anyway, you've just been revived,

240
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:39,571
so hold off on using any more magic, okay?

241
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:41,948
That took me by surprise.

242
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,327
I told you dragons breathe fire
with their self-made fuel, right?

243
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,579
Your fire ignited that fuel.

244
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,789
It won't go out.

245
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:52,292
The fat in its body is burning.

246
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,585
It'll eventually go out.

247
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,255
Until then,
I won't be able to get its meat.

248
00:14:58,256 --> 00:14:59,591
What a pickle.

249
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,679
Maybe I could use that for cooking.

250
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,851
Combine flour, yeast, salt,
and water, and knead well.

251
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,603
Let it rest for a while and...

252
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,104
In the meantime, go take a bath.

253
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,608
Stretch and shape the dough,

254
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,610
then add toppings to it.

255
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:22,113
Sprinkle flour on the dragon's skin,

256
00:15:22,697 --> 00:15:25,116
then, put them inside the dragon.

257
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:27,869
Cut off the tip of the tail.

258
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:29,871
What a waste!

259
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,874
Peel the skin and use it to make a soup.

260
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:39,005
Cut the meat into blocks and sear
on the hot dragon scales until golden.

261
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,007
Then, marinate in sauce.

262
00:15:45,136 --> 00:15:46,262
It's done!

263
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:47,555
DRAGON TAIL SOUP

264
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:50,517
ONION PIZZA, ROAST RED DRAGON

265
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,269
Looks so good!

266
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:55,855
Can we eat it?

267
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,232
- Of course, not!
- Of course, not!

268
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:08,284
It's delicious!

269
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:11,287
It feels like the first meal
I had in a long time.

270
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,205
Good!

271
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,249
It's your turn to eat your fill of it.

272
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:15,709
Oh, well.

273
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,752
She seems to be enjoying it, so.

274
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:29,597
It's really chewy,
but the taste is oddly familiar.

275
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:32,017
What is this taste?

276
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:34,060
It's not quite like beef or pork, though.

277
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:36,938
And this flavor reminds me...

278
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:39,774
a little of Living Armor, don't you think?

279
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:40,942
Does it?

280
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:43,820
It doesn't have that rusty smell, though.

281
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,157
And the Kelpie and frog meat
were more tender.

282
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:49,200
If anything, it's a bit like the Basilisk.

283
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,077
What do you think, Laios?

284
00:16:53,997 --> 00:16:56,082
I don't know what you're all on about.

285
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,333
This vibrant red!

286
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,085
This firmness!

287
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:00,837
This rich taste!

288
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:03,590
Each characteristic is like no other!

289
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,469
Why compare the taste of dragon
with other creatures in the first place?

290
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,222
This is the taste of a dragon!

291
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,771
Um, Falin.

292
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,482
You might have
already figured this out, but...

293
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:23,985
We couldn't afford to buy food,
so we made it this far by eating monsters.

294
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,614
That's amazing.

295
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,991
That's amazing!

296
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:31,785
What monsters did you eat?

297
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:34,037
H-How did you prepare them?

298
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,580
Seems like we didn't have to worry.

299
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,332
This is exactly what I was afraid of!

300
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,709
First, we had a Huge Scorpion and a Slime.

301
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:42,087
We even tried a Walking Mushroom.

302
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:43,546
A Walking Mushroom?

303
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,633
We even harvested vegetables from Golems.

304
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,469
What about a Fish-man?

305
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,763
We didn't try that.

306
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:53,765
But we did eat Living Armor.

307
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:55,767
What?! What part did you eat?

308
00:17:55,767 --> 00:18:02,315
Um, it's actually a colony of mollusks
wearing a shell and...

309
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,193
Wouldn't it be simpler
to just show her the real thing?

310
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,615
What's this?

311
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:18,706
Why didn't you tell us about it?!

312
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:19,999
Sorry.

313
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:23,419
It's cute. Is it a pulmonata?

314
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:28,800
It went back inside.

315
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,139
It moves on its own.

316
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,765
Seriously?

317
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:36,683
My bad.

318
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:40,812
I planned to keep it temporarily
until I found another weapon at first.

319
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:43,439
But I kept it because
of its useful reactions to other monsters.

320
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,484
So that's how you showed
really sharp instincts now and then!

321
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:48,653
We should've gotten Namari to examine it.

322
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:52,824
In that situation, I agree
you had no choice but to use the sword.

323
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:54,576
But it shouldn't have been
a solo decision.

324
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:58,621
The greatest damage
is the loss of trust from your teammates.

325
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,373
It was careless of me.

326
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,875
It won't happen again.

327
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,835
So, what will you do with it?

328
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,337
Until I find another weapon,
I'd like to keep using it.

329
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:09,507
<i>I could dunk it in water
and drown the creature.</i>

330
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:11,384
<i>I'd have to disassemble
the sword to remove it,</i>

331
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,303
<i>so it'll probably rot inside, though.</i>

332
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:14,470
<i>That's kinda unpleasant.</i>

333
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,347
<i>I suppose we can wait and see for a while.</i>

334
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:19,809
You're the one
who said monsters are dangerous.

335
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:22,854
It's not like I forgot about that.

336
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:24,856
But I thought I had neutralized it

337
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:27,859
and that I could use it to my advantage.

338
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:29,986
But it didn't pan out.

339
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:32,614
I guess it's impossible to use a monster
while keeping it alive.

340
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:35,533
What does it taste like?

341
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:37,118
Wanna try?

342
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:39,245
Oh, yeah!

343
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:50,048
There are a lot of doors,
but only two of them lead outside.

344
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:51,883
No need to worry
about surprise attacks, then.

345
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,140
This house seems quite comfortable.

346
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,392
The fact it has seven toilets
raises questions, though.

347
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:03,394
All right. Let's get some sleep here.

348
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:04,854
Hurray!

349
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:07,106
It's been so long
since I last slept on a bed!

350
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,692
We'll still have to use
our sleeping bags as blankets, though.

351
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:19,494
Sorry for intruding on your home
without asking.

352
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:21,996
We'll leave as soon as we rest a little.

353
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:23,915
What's the matter?

354
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:25,541
I think she's a resident.

355
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,918
She says she'll let us stay.

356
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:28,419
I see.

357
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:29,587
That's great.

358
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:34,676
We're short on sleeping bags,
so we'll have to share on the way back.

359
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:38,388
We haven't slept in the same bed
since our school days!

360
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:40,056
I wonder if we'll both fit.

361
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,810
I've gotten much bigger since then.

362
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,270
You cheeky little!

363
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:52,110
To me, you'll always be my little girl!

364
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,199
I'm really glad I got to see you again.

365
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:00,785
Me, too.

366
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:06,457
I'll go say goodnight
to my brother before bed.

367
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,379
Laios.

368
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:13,715
Falin.

369
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:22,849
This scar...

370
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,018
You did something reckless, didn't you?

371
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:25,977
Why did you...

372
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:33,651
Just to be clear, you're the one
who did something reckless first.

373
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:35,820
So it's on you
that things turned out like this!

374
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,738
What?

375
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:39,365
Don't ever do something like that again!

376
00:21:40,074 --> 00:21:42,618
I can't even recall what I did.

377
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:50,793
I won't do it again.

378
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:56,007
Goodnight, Laios.

379
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,010
Goodnight, Falin.
