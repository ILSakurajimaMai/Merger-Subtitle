1
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,825
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:33,937
It wasn't just a myth, after all!

3
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,315
That fallen ancient kingdom
actually existed!

4
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,820
This is pure gold.

5
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,071
Incredible.

6
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,072
Hey...

7
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:47,867
Shouldn't we head back up
to the surface once?

8
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:50,578
If we want to explore,
we should be better prepared.

9
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:53,289
Stop talking nonsense.

10
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:54,374
Senshi,

11
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:57,335
are you sure you have
iron flowing in your veins?

12
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,878
Don't push yourself.

13
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,463
You wait here.

14
00:02:02,048 --> 00:02:03,967
I want gold too!

15
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:07,971
{\an8}<i>I was terrified
of being left behind, so I lied.</i>

16
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:11,391
<i>That place just didn't sit right with me.</i>

17
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:14,602
<i>And although many of my group
were ambitious from the start,</i>

18
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:17,063
<i>they were acting weird then.</i>

19
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:20,275
<i>Their eyes were gleaming in the dark,</i>

20
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:24,362
<i>and they kept plunging deeper and deeper
like they were being pulled in.</i>

21
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:28,241
<i>Then suddenly, it began.</i>

22
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:32,036
What happened?

23
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:36,124
A-A monster!

24
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:39,127
A giant bird monster
showed up out of nowhere

25
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,254
and took out Totan!

26
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:43,214
This isn't just some old ruins.

27
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,049
It's turned into a dungeon!

28
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:49,888
<i>By the time fear had jolted everyone
back to themselves,</i>

29
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,307
<i>we realized we'd lost our way back.</i>

30
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,269
What if we've been trapped in here?

31
00:02:57,353 --> 00:03:00,773
All dungeons
have a way out to the surface.

32
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:04,027
Let's keep our cool
and hunt for that exit.

33
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,489
<i>We kept roaming the dungeon,
avoiding any monsters.</i>

34
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:12,535
<i>Curiously, when we became thirsty,
we stumbled upon springs.</i>

35
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:16,080
<i>When we were exhausted,
rooms would pop up for us to rest in.</i>

36
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:21,669
<i>Some even got tempted
by a gorgeous woman in the shadows.</i>

37
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:25,798
<i>Eventually, our food ran out.</i>

38
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:28,301
If we keep going like this,
we'll starve and die.

39
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,054
We must find something to eat,
even if it means fighting.

40
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:32,347
Something to eat?

41
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:35,808
Even monsters must feed on something.

42
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:37,393
Invar, Brigan!

43
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:40,480
Use your shields to be on guard.

44
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,566
Null and I will fend off monsters
with our weapons.

45
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,943
Senshi...

46
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:48,988
You stay put
and work on mapping out this area.

47
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,074
Let's go!

48
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:59,874
That bird monster showed up again!

49
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,461
That damn thing flies off too fast.

50
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,298
I-I'll join you on the next food hunt!

51
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:09,467
No, you'll just slow us down.

52
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,636
We've found food.

53
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,346
Here, have this.

54
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:16,849
<i>Even though I wasn't exerting myself,
I still became hungry.</i>

55
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:19,269
<i>I felt so pathetic.</i>

56
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:24,232
<i>Our daily hunt for food
became more urgent than finding the exit.</i>

57
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:27,902
<i>The bird kept on our tails relentlessly.</i>

58
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:30,238
<i>With each fight, our numbers dwindled.</i>

59
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:31,739
<i>Finally, with nothing else to eat,</i>

60
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:34,492
<i>we had to resort to killing our horse.</i>

61
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:38,496
That four-legged eagle...
there's no mistaking it.

62
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,082
It's a monster called a Griffin.

63
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,584
Why is it so fixated on us?

64
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:45,878
It doesn't seem like
it's hungry or anything.

65
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:49,299
It probably just enjoys
the thrill of the kill.

66
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:52,593
They say monsters are like that.

67
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:55,847
Don't worry.

68
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,891
Next time it swoops in,
we'll roast it whole and feast on it.

69
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:02,228
Here. Be grateful to Anne and eat up.

70
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:08,318
What's up with you,

71
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:11,529
giving the biggest portion
to the useless brat?

72
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,782
He's only 36 and still needs to grow.

73
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,952
As grown-ups,
it's our duty to take care of him.

74
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:19,287
We can't afford to do that!

75
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,374
{\an8}It's over for us when we can't look after
the next generation anymore!

76
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,429
<i>I'm so hungry.</i>

77
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:39,724
<i>If iron really does flow through my veins,</i>

78
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,226
<i>I wonder if I can munch on rocks.</i>

79
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,186
Hey!

80
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:45,563
You've got a hidden stash of food,
haven't you?

81
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,940
Stop it! What's gotten into you?

82
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,525
That brat!

83
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:51,569
Let's discuss this outside.

84
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,821
You're scaring Senshi.

85
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:56,324
- How many times do I have to tell you?
- Why you! Shut up!

86
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:59,327
<i>The shouting kept getting louder.</i>

87
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,081
<i>I heard the sounds of scuffling
and a few screams.</i>

88
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:13,216
<i>Then, it went eerily silent.</i>

89
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,511
What happened?

90
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:17,428
Where's Brigan?

91
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:18,721
Stay put!

92
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,224
Don't look outside.

93
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,936
We were attacked by the Griffin.

94
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,940
I took down the Griffin,
but Brigan died instantly.

95
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:31,692
<i>When I looked at Gillin's head,</i>

96
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:35,530
<i>there was a dent in his helmet,
like it had been hit by a blunt object.</i>

97
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,324
Let's eat the Griffin.

98
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:41,327
If we clean it and make a soup out of it,

99
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,538
we could survive a few more days.

100
00:06:55,883 --> 00:07:01,180
<i>The Griffin soup, just boiled with water,
had a gamey smell and the meat was tough.</i>

101
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:02,890
<i>It tasted awful.</i>

102
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,520
<i>But I chewed intently</i>

103
00:07:07,603 --> 00:07:11,065
<i>and downed it slowly, taking my time.</i>

104
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,111
<i>Gillin said he needed to relieve himself,</i>

105
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:17,238
<i>and stepped outside unsteadily.</i>

106
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,118
<i>But he never returned.</i>

107
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:24,829
<i>I found myself all alone.</i>

108
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:29,125
<i>I lacked the courage
to peek outside the door,</i>

109
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,836
<i>and I was unable to leave the room.</i>

110
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:35,882
<i>I survived on the meat that was left</i>

111
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:38,342
<i>and pored over the maps I had sketched.</i>

112
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:42,388
<i>Eventually, I noticed a pattern
in the symbols etched on the walls.</i>

113
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:45,766
<i>When I finally gathered the courage
to step out of the room...</i>

114
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,106
<i>there were no bodies to be found.</i>

115
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,902
<i>They must have been devoured cleanly
by various creatures.</i>

116
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:59,822
<i>Later, I was captured by orcs,</i>

117
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,992
<i>and held captive
in their settlement for some time.</i>

118
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:07,079
<i>But when I tried to communicate with them,
they turned out to be quite decent folk.</i>

119
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,665
<i>In exchange for teaching them
ancient Dwarvish,</i>

120
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:13,211
<i>they taught me how to distinguish
between edible and poisonous mushrooms,</i>

121
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,796
<i>and how to handle encounters
with monsters.</i>

122
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:19,050
<i>And that's how...</i>

123
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:27,308
<i>I made it back to the surface.</i>

124
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:31,979
<i>But after everything that happened,</i>

125
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:34,815
<i>I couldn't find it in me
to return to my hometown.</i>

126
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:38,319
<i>So, I lived near the dungeon
or in its upper levels.</i>

127
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:42,406
<i>Eventually, the city on the surface
connected with the dungeon,</i>

128
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,201
<i>and many adventurers began venturing down.</i>

129
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,203
<i>What weighed on my mind</i>

130
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:51,916
<i>was whether the meat I consumed
truly came from the Griffin.</i>

131
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,836
<i>Every time I eat,
I'm haunted by the taste of that soup.</i>

132
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,716
<i>No other monster
tasted anything like that.</i>

133
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,428
That's why I fled from the Griffin.

134
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:10,142
I'm afraid of discovering the truth.

135
00:09:10,643 --> 00:09:11,978
I had no idea...

136
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:13,896
Senshi...

137
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,733
Then why not try eating that Griffin?

138
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:18,859
- Huh?
- Huh?

139
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:21,112
I mean, it's awful for him

140
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:24,740
to be haunted by that memory every time
he eats for the rest of his life.

141
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,784
If it tastes the same,
he can put his mind at ease.

142
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,828
And if it's completely different,

143
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:32,248
well, it's a shame,
but at least it won't plague him anymore.

144
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,208
It's going to plague him even more.

145
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,543
What's with him?

146
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,712
What do you think, Senshi?

147
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:42,633
You're right.

148
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:44,135
I should try it.

149
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,886
Senshi...

150
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:47,805
All right then!

151
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:51,434
Let's recreate the cooking
as closely as possible.

152
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:53,811
We'll cut out the meat
without doing much to it.

153
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:57,148
Since the upper body and lower body
might taste completely different,

154
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,274
we'll take cuts from both.

155
00:09:58,357 --> 00:10:00,151
You just want to eat it.

156
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:06,324
That's some impressive muscle.

157
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,034
It's not a carnivore for nothing.

158
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:11,829
Why did the Griffin pursue
Senshi and his group so relentlessly?

159
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:15,291
It might have killed people,
but it didn't seem keen on eating them.

160
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:18,127
They had a horse though.

161
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,170
Maybe that's why.

162
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,047
Griffins have a penchant for horses.

163
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:24,258
But then why didn't it target
the horse first?

164
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:25,176
No idea.

165
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:27,678
I'll get some water boiling.

166
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:32,725
<i>The Griffin's weapons
are its front claws and beak.</i>

167
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:36,562
<i>It can't leave a dent on you
like you were hit by a blunt object.</i>

168
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,940
<i>So whatever killed Brigan
probably wasn't a Griffin.</i>

169
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:43,444
<i>But what about the other three?</i>

170
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,864
<i>Just like how we mistook
Falin for a Griffin,</i>

171
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,158
<i>maybe it was
a different monster altogether.</i>

172
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,869
<i>There are many large monsters with wings.</i>

173
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,831
<i>The Cockatrice, Basilisk, Harpy, Siren,</i>

174
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:58,918
<i>Pegasus, Simurgh, and Roc.</i>

175
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:02,421
<i>Which of these monsters possesses
a weapon resembling a blunt object?</i>

176
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:04,882
The water's boiling.

177
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:07,551
Do we just let it boil like this?

178
00:11:07,635 --> 00:11:09,345
Should we add other ingredients?

179
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:10,554
No, that's it.

180
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,099
<i>It's going to be a bland soup.</i>

181
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:15,518
<i>It'd be nice if we had some garnish.</i>

182
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,940
By the way, you mentioned that the orcs
taught you how to distinguish mushrooms.

183
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:23,025
But is this your first time
seeing these mushrooms?

184
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:24,819
Yeah, I've never seen them before.

185
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:28,989
Marcille, I'm leaving the rest to you.

186
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:30,574
- Huh? Hey!
- Huh?

187
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,952
You've come this far,
and now you're backing out?

188
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:34,078
So flighty!

189
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:36,288
Fine, forget it then.

190
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:38,249
This won't help Senshi anyway.

191
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:41,460
No, we've come this far, so let me try it.

192
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:44,046
I'll accept whatever truth awaits me.

193
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,179
GRIFFIN SOUP (UPPER BODY)
(LOWER BODY)

194
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:53,222
It's done.

195
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:00,980
This...

196
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:04,859
doesn't taste anything like
what I had that day.

197
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:10,322
What I ate back then must have been...

198
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:12,283
You mean...

199
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,200
It's fine.

200
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,161
A weight has been lifted.

201
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,206
Gillin must have wanted me to survive,
no matter what.

202
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,168
I'll carry on with that wish.

203
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:24,128
Laios, you moron!

204
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,546
What have you done?!

205
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:32,386
Griffin meat is very gamey and tough.

206
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,805
More than anything,
the aftertaste is just awful.

207
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,099
{\an8}That's right.

208
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:40,311
{\an8}Senshi didn't eat Griffin meat that day.

209
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,898
But it wasn't human flesh either!

210
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:47,568
What attacked them was a Hippogriff,
not a Griffin.

211
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,195
A Hippogriff?

212
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:51,489
Unlike a Griffin,
which has the lower body of a lion,

213
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,532
a Hippogriff
is a close relative of a horse.

214
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:57,077
It likely kept chasing them down
because they had a horse.

215
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,455
Maybe it was curious or in heat.

216
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,958
Plus, a Hippogriff
has a weapon a Griffin lacks.

217
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,753
<i>Hind legs with hooves.</i>

218
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:10,007
<i>Its kick could tear through metal,
leaving a sizable hole.</i>

219
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,677
I assure you, Senshi!

220
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:16,514
If what you had that day was a Hippogriff,

221
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:19,350
then it's only natural
it would taste different from this soup.

222
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:24,813
Thank you, Laios.

223
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:27,525
I feel a bit better hearing that.

224
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:31,487
Even though there's no way
to confirm what a Hippogriff tastes like.

225
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:35,407
{\an8}Let's find out then.

226
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:36,992
{\an8}- Huh?
- Huh?

227
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:39,745
{\an8}Let's compare it to Hippogriff meat.

228
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:42,456
I thought you were going
to wrap it up with something like,

229
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,918
"The truth remains uncertain,
but now there's a glimmer of hope."

230
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,837
I mean, where would we
even find a Hippogriff?

231
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:50,506
Well,

232
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:53,133
we have a Hippogriff right here!

233
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:56,262
There must have been reports of one
in this dungeon in the past.

234
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,806
{\an8}So why didn't we notice them?

235
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:02,601
{\an8}Because we were fighting a Griffin
that shouldn't even be in this dungeon.

236
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:03,519
{\an8}Why is that?

237
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:07,147
Because the presence
of an accomplice complicated things.

238
00:14:07,856 --> 00:14:09,024
An accomplice?

239
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,152
Changelings.

240
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,490
Now that I think about it,
that legend comes from your hometown.

241
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,201
Ever heard of Changeling Children?

242
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:22,288
It's a phenomenon
where children are swapped with monsters.

243
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:27,793
<i>A child who goes to play in the woods
returns home as an identical troll.</i>

244
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:30,671
<i>For a long time, they were believed
to be a type of magic.</i>

245
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:31,922
<i>But recently,</i>

246
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:35,175
<i>it's been discovered that it's the work
of these mushroom-like monsters.</i>

247
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,930
<i>Those who step into a ring of them
undergo a subtle change.</i>

248
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,849
Once people learned about this,

249
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:44,143
they eradicated the mushrooms,
and now they're rare.

250
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:46,020
To think we'd find them growing here.

251
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,398
<i>The way the Griffin seized Senshi
but didn't eat him.</i>

252
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:52,526
<i>The sharp kick that killed the Familiar.</i>

253
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,113
<i>It's likely that
the Griffin we fought was actually...</i>

254
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:58,115
Let's find out.

255
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,162
Place Griffin meat
inside a Changeling fairy ring.

256
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:07,499
The meat looks different.

257
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,919
It's marbled with fat and looks delicious.

258
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:12,379
All right, let's make soup from this.

259
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:18,928
HIPPOGRIFF SOUP

260
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:37,780
S-Senshi?

261
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:41,283
W-Well, flavors can vary depending on
conditions and environments,

262
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:42,785
so I wouldn't worry about it...

263
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:45,955
No. That's not it.

264
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:48,916
I've been wanting

265
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:52,503
to taste this soup again for a long time.

266
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:59,051
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

267
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:02,262
Thank you.

268
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:09,770
Living in this dungeon for a long time
has made me realize something.

269
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:13,691
This dungeon responds strongly
to a person's desires,

270
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:17,027
whether it's wealth, knowledge, or fame.

271
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:22,950
It's accommodating to those like orcs
who don't seek anything from it.

272
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:26,286
But the moment you desire something,
it shows its fangs.

273
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,455
From now on,

274
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:33,961
<i>not only will you aim to rescue Falin,
but you'll also be searching</i>

275
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:36,547
<i>for the lunatic magician
and the Winged Lion.</i>

276
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:40,551
The dungeon's response
will become even more severe.

277
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:42,052
Still,

278
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:46,974
there are many things I want to teach you.

279
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:49,351
Will you take me with you?

280
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,437
Of course!

281
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:57,985
Okay, everyone!

282
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,445
Let's get going!

283
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,038
How are you all feeling?

284
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:11,415
I'm feeling cold.

285
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,374
I might not make it.

286
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,919
{\an8}<i>This has to be food poisoning, right?</i>

287
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:19,423
{\an8}<i>I mean, we've eaten all sorts of things.</i>

288
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,593
{\an8}<i>But we can't afford to die here.</i>

289
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:24,344
<i>Falin...</i>

290
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,600
<i>How long was I out?</i>

291
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:30,851
<i>I feel lighter.</i>

292
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:33,228
<i>Has the food poisoning passed?</i>

293
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:34,396
<i>Good.</i>

294
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,231
<i>I was afraid that...</i>

295
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:40,986
What's going on?

296
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,238
Marcille.

297
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:44,531
Look at me.

298
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:46,366
Does my body look strange to you?

299
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:52,623
Marcille has shrunk too!

300
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:53,957
Senshi, this is bad!

301
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,501
Wake up! Sen--

302
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:58,879
W-Who are you?!

303
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,841
What's with all the racket?

304
00:18:02,925 --> 00:18:03,842
Chil...

305
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:06,762
Chilchuck, sir?

306
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:14,853
It looks like
we stepped on some Changelings.

307
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:17,815
H-How is this even possible?

308
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,484
They transformed a Griffin
into a Hippogriff.

309
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,903
They could do this to people.

310
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:24,655
I'm a dwarf now.

311
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,406
Senshi is an elf.

312
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,659
Marcille is a half-foot?

313
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,661
And Chilchuck is a tall-man.

314
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,579
Izutsumi...

315
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,206
is a dog.

316
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:36,458
No, I think that's a kobold.

317
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,127
A kobold with cat ears.

318
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:39,920
Now,

319
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:42,673
how do we get back our bodies?

320
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:45,425
We'll have to retrace our steps.

321
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:48,178
If we step inside a mushroom ring,
we'll be able to revert, right?

322
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,347
That's my assumption,

323
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,682
but take a look outside.

324
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,059
The path has shifted.

325
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:57,563
While we were laid up,
I couldn't stop shaking.

326
00:18:57,646 --> 00:19:00,524
Are you saying it was the dungeon,
not my body, that was shaking?

327
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:02,943
I'm not sure we can make it back,

328
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:04,695
but let's return to the reservoir.

329
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,201
<i>The luggage feels really light.</i>

330
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,204
Marcille, I'll carry some of your stuff.

331
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:15,831
Thanks.

332
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,167
<i>I'm liking this body.</i>

333
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,252
<i>I can see well in the dark.</i>

334
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:22,838
<i>I might even be able to beat Namari
in an arm wrestle now.</i>

335
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,215
Chilchuck, how's that body of yours?

336
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,596
It feels like I'm enveloped in a heavy,
transparent, and thick membrane.

337
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,515
So, your senses are dulled?

338
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,725
Yeah.

339
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:37,186
But it's strangely calming.

340
00:19:37,686 --> 00:19:41,481
Oh, and it's also nice to be able
to look down on you guys.

341
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:07,633
Wait, is this door...

342
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,723
Ugh, this is where
we were originally headed!

343
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:16,350
The deepest point, huh?

344
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:19,895
We intended to turn back,
but ended up pressing forward.

345
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:22,231
Someone set up camp here.

346
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:25,150
It seems other adventurers have been here.

347
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:29,321
Do you think
they might know how to fix us?

348
00:20:31,198 --> 00:20:33,700
I doubt they ventured beyond this door.

349
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:36,286
They might have already
teleported back to the surface.

350
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,914
What do we do then?

351
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:40,916
{\an8}I've been thinking...

352
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:43,543
{\an8}why don't we continue searching
for the Winged Lion like this?

353
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:44,544
{\an8}Huh?

354
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:48,465
The dungeon
doesn't seem inclined to release us.

355
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:52,719
Instead of wasting time resisting it,
it might be quicker to press onward.

356
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,054
Of course,

357
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:57,015
once we make it back to the surface,
I'm sure there'll be plenty of solutions.

358
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:59,101
I'm not suggesting
we stay like this forever.

359
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:00,102
{\an8}That's absurd!

360
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,980
{\an8}Just because you've become
a long-lived race...

361
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,314
{\an8}He has a point.

362
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:07,651
{\an8}I haven't experienced
any inconvenience so far.

363
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:10,570
{\an8}So what if the size of our ears
is a little different anyway?

364
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,242
Say we press on then.

365
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:17,494
What's the plan for that door?

366
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,830
Everyone's fussing
because it won't open, right?

367
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:22,374
Do you think you can unlock it, Chilchuck?

368
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,919
Well, it'd need to have a lock
in the first place.

369
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:27,838
I think it operates with magic.

370
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:31,383
I can sense magic flowing through it,

371
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:34,094
but deciphering it would require
time, equipment, and money.

372
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:39,016
Yaad, what do we do about this?!

373
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,144
Help us, Winged Lion!

374
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:43,061
- Hey!
- Hey!

375
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:44,604
Hey!

376
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:46,690
Laios, something's sprouting!

377
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:48,984
Kensuke?!

378
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,611
Why is it growing?

379
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:54,865
I thought the bitter cold had killed it.

380
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,205
The door...

381
00:22:02,706 --> 00:22:06,168
Do you think
the Winged Lion is helping us?

382
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:08,378
It could be thanks to Yaad.

383
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:10,088
We should thank them all the same.

384
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,217
- Thanks, Lion or Yaad!
- Thanks, Lion or Yaad!

385
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:18,764
There! I thought I saw something move!

386
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:28,857
It's a Gargoyle!

387
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:30,776
Here it comes!

388
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:33,361
As you can see,
Gargoyles are moving stone statues.

389
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:36,531
Striking them will only end up
hurting you, so be careful.

390
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,409
{\an8}<i>There's nothing I can do here.</i>

391
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:41,495
{\an8}<i>I'll back off so I won't get in their way.</i>

392
00:22:44,372 --> 00:22:46,416
Huh? Why is it coming after me?

393
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,627
Because you stand out the most!

394
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,046
You're big, so you should fight too!

395
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:52,631
Don't be ridiculous! I can't--

396
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:57,719
Chilchuck!

397
00:22:57,803 --> 00:22:59,596
It's okay! It wasn't a direct hit--

398
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:05,060
{\an8}Marcille?!

399
00:23:05,143 --> 00:23:08,063
{\an8}E-Everything's swirling
with rainbow colors.

400
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:10,524
{\an8}Is it mana sickness? With just one attack?

401
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:11,858
{\an8}This is bad.

402
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:14,152
{\an8}Izutsumi, cover Chilchuck's back.

403
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:17,322
Stay!

404
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:18,365
No, Izutsumi.

405
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:20,700
Don't move until I say so!

406
00:23:20,784 --> 00:23:23,578
<i>The loud noises and the smell of blood
are getting her all riled up.</i>

407
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:26,373
<i>If she starts fighting,
she won't stop until she's dead.</i>

408
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:27,749
Senshi, grab the pot!

409
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,586
Senshi? Why aren't you holding anything?

410
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,588
Because it's too heavy.

411
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:40,637
<i>Never mind. The sword and pot
feel much lighter than usual.</i>

412
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:43,348
<i>At this rate, I can win on my own.</i>

413
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:44,266
<i>Except...</i>

414
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:46,893
<i>how do I put it?</i>

415
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,520
<i>This body...</i>

416
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:51,022
<i>is really exhausting!</i>

417
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:53,024
<i>Damn, we're going to lose.</i>

418
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:55,110
Everyone, get out of here!

419
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:57,779
Senshi, carry Marcille
and head behind that door.

420
00:23:57,863 --> 00:23:59,281
Izutsumi.

421
00:23:59,364 --> 00:24:01,825
Follow this bell!

422
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,412
Chilchuck, take this pot lid!

423
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:07,455
Run for it!

424
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:21,636
Oh no.

425
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:25,098
This body is seriously inconvenient.

426
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,934
And there's no going back now.

427
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:29,936
It can't be helped.

428
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,981
Let's just hope those mushrooms
are growing ahead.

429
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:40,989
This is a genuine dwarf relic.

430
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:44,784
Do those mushrooms grow around here too?

431
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,494
It's really hot.

432
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,623
Maybe we should start cooking.

433
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:55,754
Now I get why Senshi
always starts cooking out of the blue.

434
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:59,466
This body gets really hungry.

435
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:04,262
I've never seen Namari
randomly start preparing food though.

436
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:08,308
Cooking is perfect for self-reflection.

437
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:12,771
<i>Knead together flour, water,
salt, and egg thoroughly,</i>

438
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:14,189
<i>then let it rest.</i>

439
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:19,152
<i>Meanwhile, combine chopped onions
and other vegetables with minced meat,</i>

440
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:20,904
<i>and mix well.</i>

441
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:23,406
<i>Shape the rested dough into a long stick.</i>

442
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,533
<i>Cut it into equal pieces,</i>

443
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:27,160
<i>and roll each piece into thin sheets.</i>

444
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,538
<i>Place the filling onto
the rolled-out dough then wrap it up.</i>

445
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:32,040
<i>Keep wrapping.</i>

446
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:43,760
It's strange.

447
00:25:44,302 --> 00:25:48,139
Working in silence
is helping me calm down.

448
00:25:48,223 --> 00:25:50,016
Aren't we making too much?

449
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,434
That turned out really nicely.

450
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:56,564
It's done.

451
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:59,276
BOILED HIPPOGRIFF DUMPLINGS

452
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:03,154
The shape is familiar,
but the smell is totally different.

453
00:26:03,238 --> 00:26:04,447
It's kind of odd.

454
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:06,533
No potato or cheese in them, huh?

455
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:09,035
Back in my hometown, we usually fry them.

456
00:26:09,744 --> 00:26:11,037
- Let's dig in.
- Let's dig in.

457
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:17,127
Careful not to burn yourself.

458
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,169
Say that first!

459
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:20,046
Is it just me

460
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,215
or does it taste surprisingly good?

461
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:24,676
Do racial differences affect taste too?

462
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:28,179
No, I think anyone would find this tasty.

463
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:29,681
It's strange, isn't it?

464
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:33,643
{\an8}Every region and race has its own
different ways of cooking dumplings,

465
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,770
{\an8}yet they all taste delicious.

466
00:26:36,646 --> 00:26:38,315
R-Right!

467
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:41,276
It's just like us right now.

468
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,113
Even though some things have changed,
we're still ourselves.

469
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:46,698
We'll make it work.

470
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:49,159
That wraps things up nicely, doesn't it?

471
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:51,077
Only in your head.

472
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:54,456
Anyway, this place is odd.

473
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,124
I wonder what it was.

474
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:59,586
It's a defensive stronghold
built by dwarves, right?

475
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:01,254
Defensive?

476
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:04,049
From when the elves
and dwarves were at war.

477
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:06,551
Didn't you learn about it in school?

478
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:09,971
They competed to develop
more and more advanced technology,

479
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:12,307
which eventually led to a catastrophe.

480
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,145
Elves and dwarves
are afraid of history repeating itself,

481
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:20,065
which is why they're prickly
about technology in the dungeon.

482
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:24,319
This dungeon, in particular,
is where many cultures intersect,

483
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:27,364
so I imagine we're going to have
a lot of conflicts when elves step in.

484
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:29,574
Yeah, a-about that.

485
00:27:29,657 --> 00:27:33,870
If we run into trouble with the elves,
you can do something about it, right?

486
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,455
Huh? Why me?

487
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:38,541
You said your mom worked at the court.

488
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,959
Don't you have connections?

489
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:41,461
W-Well...

490
00:27:41,544 --> 00:27:42,879
Now, now.

491
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,215
Anyway, she's a half-foot now.

492
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,842
{\an8}If anyone's going to negotiate
with the elves, it's Senshi.

493
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:51,888
I'll do what I can.

494
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:57,060
Actually, we should keep searching
for a way to revert back.

495
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:58,728
- Agreed.
- Agreed.
