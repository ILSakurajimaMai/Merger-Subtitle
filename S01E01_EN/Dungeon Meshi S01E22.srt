00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,825
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:39,025
<i>I smell something good.</i>

3
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:45,323
Senshi?

4
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:52,914
There he is.

5
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:54,874
I see you woke up.

6
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,251
Good morning.

7
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,419
You made breakfast?

8
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:01,673
Senshi is a very fine cook.

9
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:03,383
He really is.

10
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:05,009
Senshi is amazing.

11
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,430
BREAKFAST PREPARED BY SENSHI

12
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:17,188
So good!

13
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:19,899
Yaad, would you like to try some?

14
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,986
But I can't taste...

15
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,154
Here.

16
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:34,998
It's warm and soft.

17
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:38,293
Your sense of taste is like a muscle.

18
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:41,004
If you don't use it, it weakens.

19
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:44,924
Start by savoring the texture.

20
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,009
Right.

21
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:47,719
Oh, look at you.

22
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:53,725
Long ago, every now and then,

23
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:56,769
I used to sit at the table like this
with my grandfather and parents.

24
00:02:57,353 --> 00:02:59,689
<i>Always beside my grandfather
stood Thistle,</i>

25
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,984
<i>the lunatic magician.</i>

26
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,322
<i>My great-grandfather originally
welcomed him into the castle as a jester.</i>

27
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:11,284
<i>They say my grandfather and Thistle
were raised together like brothers.</i>

28
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:15,121
<i>When my grandfather ascended the throne,
he encouraged Thistle to study magic.</i>

29
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:17,206
<i>And Thistle began to distinguish himself.</i>

30
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,878
<i>Our realm was once abundant
with relics from dwarves and elves,</i>

31
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:24,797
<i>likely including items of black magic.</i>

32
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,843
<i>Thistle's thirst for power consumed him
and drove him toward madness.</i>

33
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:32,263
<i>Ultimately, he cast a spell of immortality
over the kingdom.</i>

34
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,225
I actually want to talk to him.

35
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,560
Where can I meet him?

36
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:39,103
Talk to him?

37
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:41,022
Absolutely not!

38
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,816
Having a conversation with him
is impossible.

39
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,237
<i>It was a struggle just to let
my grandfather slip away unnoticed.</i>

40
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:50,448
<i>Some were even put to death
on suspicion of aiding him.</i>

41
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:53,451
Simply meeting the magician
is easy enough.

42
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:58,164
<i>The magician's eyes are
sensing something amiss in this village.</i>

43
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:00,917
<i>It's only a matter of time
before he arrives himself.</i>

44
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:05,338
<i>This dungeon is like his arms and legs.</i>

45
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,383
<i>You're familiar
with his terrifying power, aren't you?</i>

46
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,594
But I still need to try.

47
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:15,098
I don't know if you can have
a conversation with him.

48
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:19,602
<i>But seek the aid of the Winged Lion
imprisoned in the depths of the dungeon.</i>

49
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,897
<i>You should be able
to subdue the magician's power.</i>

50
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,947
This passage will lead you
within the castle walls,

51
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,741
taking you back to the dungeon.

52
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:35,952
Please take this!

53
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:37,620
Thank you.

54
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:42,417
{\an8}Don't give them too much,
or it will burden the carriers.

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,626
{\an8}The carriers?

56
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,338
{\an8}I'll have them take you back
the same way they brought you here.

57
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,843
Thank you. We owe you.

58
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:53,720
Good luck.

59
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:04,814
I know I shouldn't say this,
but are they really the ones?

60
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:06,774
I'd like to think so.

61
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,238
Yaad.

62
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:13,906
T-Thistle!

63
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,785
Who were you talking to just now?

64
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,668
For the umpteenth time!

65
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:26,836
This place...

66
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,504
Ow...

67
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:31,466
{\an8}It's a reservoir
crafted by ancient dwarves.

68
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:34,719
{\an8}That insanely huge place, right?
Which section of it are we now?

69
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,472
My compass isn't working.

70
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:41,601
Dwarves do cunning stuff like that.

71
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:44,479
Apparently, it was also once
a defensive stronghold.

72
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:46,022
<i>Dwarves...</i>

73
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,859
Senshi, are you feeling
teleportation sickness?

74
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:53,362
Given dwarves' sensitive
semicircular canals, it's quite common.

75
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:55,698
Do gnomes suffer from it as well?

76
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:58,242
I think they get mana sickness too.

77
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:00,745
Where am I?

78
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,413
Are you back to yourself?

79
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:04,248
W-What...

80
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:08,419
Are you okay?

81
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,505
Rest there a little.

82
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:12,256
We'll go explore the area.

83
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,011
Chil.

84
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:19,514
Can you see these marks here?

85
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:23,893
Yeah, I see them.

86
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:27,063
I need you to draw the symbols
on the pillars surrounding us.

87
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,524
It will aid us in estimating
our approximate location.

88
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,609
How do you know about that?

89
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,945
These locations typically have them.

90
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,655
They're like a code.

91
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:41,744
Well, it means not all dwarves
have a strong sense of direction.

92
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:47,542
I've got it.

93
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,752
It seems we're in the southeast section--

94
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:52,171
Everyone, listen!

95
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:54,048
They're back.

96
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:56,676
We might have found Falin!

97
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,512
These are Falin's tracks?

98
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,306
She spotted us and ran away, though.

99
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,891
I'm sure it was her.

100
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:06,227
It was her silhouette, right?

101
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:10,314
I think it was a Griffin
or something similar.

102
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,943
A-A Griffin?

103
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:17,530
It's a monster with the upper body
of a bird and the lower body of a lion.

104
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:20,616
I've never heard of Griffins
being in this dungeon.

105
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,703
Do you recognize the scent?

106
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,663
I'm not a dog, you know.

107
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,460
It smells like a beast.

108
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,587
Anyway, we have to track her down quickly.

109
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,588
No.

110
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:35,590
Huh?

111
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:37,258
No? Why?

112
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:39,177
Well, um...

113
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,803
It might be Falin.

114
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:42,221
Well...

115
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:45,349
T-Those are mushrooms
I've never seen before.

116
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,851
I want to try cooking them.

117
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:47,977
Mushrooms?

118
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,980
I recall seeing them somewhere.

119
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:53,608
They're poisonous,
so don't think of eating them.

120
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:55,776
I don't like Griffins.

121
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,613
How can you dislike
a monster you've never met?

122
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:00,239
Whatever. Let's go!

123
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:02,283
- W-Wait! Don't!
- Huh?

124
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,784
It's risky to move about!

125
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:05,203
Watch out!

126
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:11,292
{\an8}I knew it.

127
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,752
It's a Griffin!

128
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,343
So cool! I've never seen one before!

129
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,802
A Griffin...

130
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:24,805
All that fuss for nothing!

131
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:27,099
It's coming back!

132
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:28,059
Get back!

133
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:31,062
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

134
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:37,401
<i>Rufermus Sperae Alamandras Tronsum.
Yovis Stantinus Histum...</i>

135
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,364
My aim!

136
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,699
Senshi! Don't run with your back to it!

137
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,209
- Senshi!
- Senshi!

138
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:03,094
This is bad.

139
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:07,014
It happened so quickly,
I couldn't do anything.

140
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,267
Did Senshi have any weapons with him?

141
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,810
No, he was unarmed.

142
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,186
We have to go after him now!

143
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,481
Will you climb up each pillar
to look for him?

144
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:17,066
Well, I won't.

145
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:18,818
<i>Which way did it go?</i>

146
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,362
<i>If it's taken him to a high place,
there's nothing we can do.</i>

147
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:23,072
<i>We won't even be able to find his body.</i>

148
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,032
<i>Just like that?</i>

149
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:26,492
<i>He was unarmed...</i>

150
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:27,994
<i>We might never see him again.</i>

151
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,705
Marcille, is there anything we can do?

152
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:37,086
We'll summon Familiars to search for him.

153
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,546
Familiars?

154
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:40,047
You're going to conjure monsters?

155
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:43,759
It's more accurate
to say "create" than "conjure."

156
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:45,595
There are three types of summoning.

157
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:49,807
<i>First, you can dominate
and control existing spirits or monsters.</i>

158
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,934
<i>But the conditions for this are complex,</i>

159
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,854
<i>and it might attract the attention
of the lord of the dungeon.</i>

160
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:58,524
<i>Second, you can alter
animals and plants into monsters.</i>

161
00:09:58,608 --> 00:09:59,859
<i>But this isn't an option either,</i>

162
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:02,361
<i>as it takes an immense amount
of time and preparation.</i>

163
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:05,114
Third, you can create them from scratch.

164
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,532
This time, we'll use this method.

165
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,618
It sounds the most complicated.

166
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:11,662
It is if you're creating
an autonomous creature.

167
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:14,624
But for now,
we only need one that's mobile.

168
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,294
I'll prepare the magic circle,

169
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:20,713
so gather all the meat we have
and throw it into a pot.

170
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:21,756
Got it.

171
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,428
Is that all we have?

172
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,430
It'd be better if we had a bit more.

173
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,476
There's nothing else.

174
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,269
We do have cheese and eggs, though.

175
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:36,354
And vegetables!

176
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:40,524
I suppose they'll help boost
the calorie count.

177
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:41,525
Fetch them.

178
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:42,443
Right.

179
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:48,741
What kind of monster are you making?

180
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,493
Can you control it at will?

181
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:51,577
Show me how to do it.

182
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,495
Absolutely not!

183
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:56,082
Get certified to handle dangerous magic
through the proper channels first!

184
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,418
There's actually a process for that?

185
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:03,172
Hey, who's that old guy anyway?

186
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,174
How did he join your group?

187
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:08,135
And what's with his obsession with food?

188
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:11,097
Huh?

189
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,683
Are you saying you don't know,
after acting so friendly with him?

190
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:17,728
Well, we just never had the opportunity.

191
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:21,190
None of us are keen
on discussing our personal lives.

192
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:22,942
{\an8}But...

193
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,528
<i>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.</i>

194
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:28,447
<i>There's a lot to question
about Senshi's words and actions.</i>

195
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,659
Do you remember what he said
when we first met him?

196
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:36,330
He claimed to have been studying monster
food in this dungeon for over ten years.

197
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:39,750
<i>But this dungeon
was only discovered six years ago.</i>

198
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,210
<i>But...</i>

199
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:46,006
<i>He carries a couple of pots and knives
crafted from precious metals too.</i>

200
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,676
<i>And he managed
to decipher ancient dwarf code.</i>

201
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,804
<i>He's afraid of a monster
from a level we haven't explored yet.</i>

202
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:53,973
<i>And he persistently treats me
as if I'm a kid.</i>

203
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:56,475
The last statement is a bit too nitpicky.

204
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,435
Nope.

205
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:00,938
Folks who aren't familiar with our race
often make this mistake.

206
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,649
They don't get that half-foots
are their own race.

207
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:07,361
They think we'll turn into tall-men
or dwarves when we're grown.

208
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:08,654
But...

209
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:11,949
these misconceptions are only present
in certain places, like the East.

210
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,202
{\an8}If he's been on this island for a decade,
he should know better.

211
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:19,457
{\an8}Maybe he's not from the surface at all.

212
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:22,918
Once we manage to rescue Senshi,

213
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:25,588
we should reintroduce ourselves.

214
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:31,927
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

215
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:35,556
<i>Rufermus Sperae Vilal Indumreezbam.</i>

216
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,267
{\an8}<i>Martis Tilnunt Eesdum.</i>

217
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,354
{\an8}<i>Histum Eres Anjarkant Rementalent.</i>

218
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,197
Is it ready?

219
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:53,199
It should be.

220
00:12:54,116 --> 00:12:55,826
Let's open the lid.

221
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:15,387
Thank goodness!

222
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:17,723
I was worried,
but it looks like it worked!

223
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:20,601
What's with the expression?
As long as they move, it's fine!

224
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:24,063
We can't waste limited resources
on unnecessary details!

225
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:25,356
Okay, fly!

226
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:29,527
What's wrong?

227
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,155
Their vision is overlapping with mine,
and it's making me sick.

228
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:35,658
Someone, cover my eyes.

229
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:40,371
The lunatic magician
controls many of these.

230
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,706
How does he manage all the information?

231
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,916
I'm so curious.

232
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,751
Save that for later.

233
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,044
Right now, focus on Senshi.

234
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,380
I'll look for any foreign objects

235
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,423
by following
the Dungeon Cleaners and spirits.

236
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:53,300
Follow me!

237
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,597
You can't follow, is that it?

238
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:01,183
I-It's not easy to walk while flying!

239
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:02,935
I'll carry her.

240
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:05,020
Izutsumi and Chil, take my stuff.

241
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,064
Here we go, Marcille.

242
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,650
What? I'm scared!

243
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,485
Put your arms around me.

244
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,279
No! I'm going to fall!

245
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:14,446
Stay still or you will fall!

246
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:19,451
What kind of position is that?

247
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,745
It seems like
this is the most comfortable for her.

248
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:32,131
The Dungeon Cleaners
are gathering around that pillar!

249
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:33,465
That's probably where...

250
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,303
Senshi!

251
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:38,679
I found him!

252
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:40,764
He's pinned high up on a pillar!

253
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:42,933
Griffins impale their prey, huh?

254
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:44,768
<i>We're here to rescue you, Senshi!</i>

255
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,270
<i>Can you tell who I am?</i>

256
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,187
A fly?

257
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:51,901
<i>He won't budge.</i>

258
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:53,319
<i>How can I get him down?</i>

259
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,195
Careful, Marcille.

260
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,323
Griffins have incredibly sharp eyes.

261
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:01,660
By the time we spot them,
they've already spotted you.

262
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:06,457
I can't see anything anymore.

263
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,793
A Griffin's body is highly functional.

264
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,629
Their wings are powerful.

265
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:14,506
Their supple bodies are agile,
with explosive power.

266
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,051
Their beaks and talons are sharp as well.

267
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,802
Outwitting one will be very challenging.

268
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,348
<i>Creatures are shaped
the way they are out of necessity.</i>

269
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,558
<i>They don't have unnecessary details.</i>

270
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:29,855
{\an8}Laios, what form would be effective
against a Griffin?

271
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:36,403
Do we really need that horn?

272
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:39,239
Streamlined bodies
experience less air resistance,

273
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,951
which should enhance agility.

274
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:46,080
<i>Remember the Wyverns
under the lunatic magician's control?</i>

275
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:47,998
<i>They were as swift as arrows.</i>

276
00:15:48,082 --> 00:15:49,833
<i>Let's try to replicate their shape.</i>

277
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,797
This should do for now.

278
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,839
Try flying it.

279
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,762
It's flying completely differently!

280
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,055
We should have a chance now!

281
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:05,182
While Senshi climbs down,

282
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,267
I'll keep the Griffin distracted!

283
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,561
Everyone else, be prepared to fight
and provide backup!

284
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,064
Why's she doing that?

285
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:14,316
Maybe she needs to feel a sense of unity.

286
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,318
<i>Come on, Senshi.</i>

287
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:18,278
<i>Use this rope!</i>

288
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:20,572
<i>Good, and now...</i>

289
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:22,700
<i>It's fast!</i>

290
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,703
<i>I'll draw the Griffin away!</i>

291
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,287
<i>Come on, follow me!</i>

292
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:33,711
<i>Now, back to the ground!</i>

293
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,468
It got me.

294
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,512
It's not good enough...

295
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:45,597
I'm no match for it at all.

296
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:46,515
What should I do?

297
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:48,559
I've got it! Leave it to me!

298
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:50,769
I'll make it stronger and tougher!

299
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:54,356
I'll add horns, give it fangs
and sharp claws!

300
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,234
I'll cover it with scales
and even add another head!

301
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,570
With more potential,
it's sure to be strong!

302
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,155
And it'll breathe fire and ice too!

303
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:02,239
So cool!

304
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,533
<i>How do I take down a Griffin?</i>

305
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:07,661
<i>Do I need to focus on offense or defense?</i>

306
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,038
<i>No!</i>

307
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,919
- My Giga Double-headed Flame Ice Dragon!
- <i>We don't need claws or fangs.</i>

308
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:19,048
<i>It should be faster, more lithe,
and more beautiful.</i>

309
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:23,927
<i>What's needed here is determination
and ego to make a creature</i>

310
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,929
<i>with the single goal of rescuing Senshi!</i>

311
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:29,433
<i>At that moment, Marcille's intense passion</i>

312
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,809
<i>and her prayers</i>

313
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:33,771
<i>brought about a miracle.</i>

314
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,315
I'll give you a name.

315
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:38,942
With silver-white wings
that streak across the skies...

316
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,322
I summon the Sky Fish!

317
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:45,032
It's so...

318
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:46,075
lame.

319
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:47,367
No, this is fine!

320
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,661
Now, go!

321
00:17:56,794 --> 00:17:58,837
- It's so fast!
- The way it moves is gross!

322
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,464
I'm going all out!

323
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,965
Everyone, get ready!

324
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,384
Seriously, what's her deal?

325
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,553
She's putting in her best effort,
that's what.

326
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,147
<i>I can't change course!</i>

327
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:21,944
<i>This time!</i>

328
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:24,905
<i>I'll turn around and...</i>

329
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:27,616
<i>Punch through!</i>

330
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:53,183
Are you okay?

331
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,685
Y-Yeah.

332
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,728
You should take a break for a bit.

333
00:18:56,812 --> 00:19:00,023
We'll start cooking,
so just rest over there.

334
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:09,908
Thank you.

335
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:12,369
You did well.

336
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,621
<i>Sky Fish...</i>

337
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:20,377
This is amazing.

338
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,880
The vegetables
are packed inside like organs.

339
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:27,384
Did you still need it?

340
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,178
No, but...

341
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,098
I was expecting you
to mourn a bit, you know?

342
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:34,766
I wanted some time for that.

343
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,226
- Are you okay, Senshi?
- Marcille.

344
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,729
They've already fulfilled their lives.

345
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:41,273
Consuming their bodies
is a way to honor them.

346
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:43,483
But still...

347
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,988
Fine. Do as you want.

348
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,742
<i>Cut the Familiar into appropriate lengths.</i>

349
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,494
<i>Remove the wings at the base.</i>

350
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:57,289
<i>Dab away excess moisture with a cloth,</i>

351
00:19:58,332 --> 00:19:59,750
<i>and season with salt and pepper.</i>

352
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,627
<i>Fold the wings up small.</i>

353
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:07,174
<i>Blend flour, egg, and water thoroughly,
then coat the slices in the mixture.</i>

354
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:08,383
<i>And deep fry them.</i>

355
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,221
<i>The wings will brown quickly
so a quick dip will do.</i>

356
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,348
<i>Serve with sauce and...</i>

357
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,141
It's done!

358
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:19,061
SKY FISH AND CHIPS

359
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,320
The meat and vegetables
have melded together and it's delicious!

360
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:29,696
Yeah, literally.

361
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:33,408
Summoning might actually be
a superior cooking technique!

362
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:37,537
If it consumes a week's worth of food
for just one meal, it's hardly superior.

363
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,208
Damn. I should've
taken their liquor along.

364
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,211
Izutsumi, eat the other parts too,
not just the wings.

365
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:45,128
I don't want to.

366
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:47,589
Senshi, have a bite too.

367
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,427
Is the Griffin bothering you?

368
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,595
Want to drain the blood?

369
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,014
N-No, never mind.

370
00:20:56,682 --> 00:20:59,017
I'm not hungry right now.

371
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:03,605
Hey, Senshi.

372
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:07,776
My name's Chilchuck.

373
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:11,947
I'm from a small village
nestled in a basin, northeast of here.

374
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:14,700
For about a decade,

375
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:17,327
I've been doing business
around different dungeons.

376
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:21,081
From picking locks to interpreting,
mediating, and appraising.

377
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:24,543
{\an8}Also, I have a wife and daughters,

378
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:26,962
{\an8}but I haven't seen them in years
for various reasons.

379
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:27,879
What?

380
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:31,341
- That's pretty much my backstory.
- A wife and daughters?

381
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:34,386
Now, tell us about yourself.

382
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,097
Why are you living down here?

383
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:38,932
What happened?

384
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:47,691
My name is Senshi of Izganda.

385
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:51,611
I used to belong to a small mining crew.

386
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:57,326
<i>We were miners, but not for ore.</i>

387
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,911
<i>We sought relics from before the war,</i>

388
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:02,497
<i>dreaming of hitting the jackpot.</i>

389
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:06,501
<i>That said, the majority
of our discoveries were ore,</i>

390
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:11,882
<i>and finding relics like gears or lenses
was a rare stroke of luck.</i>

391
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,343
{\an8}<i>Then, one day,</i>

392
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:18,180
{\an8}<i>we unearthed something huge.</i>

393
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:24,352
<i>An ancient castle gleaming with gold.</i>

394
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:28,774
That's right. It was this very dungeon.
