00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,825
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,811
Drop your weapons now.

3
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:38,399
Back up and lie on your stomach.

4
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,069
If you twitch a muscle, I'll kill her.

5
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:45,031
{\an8}Isn't she one of Shuro's retainers?

6
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:47,826
{\an8}Was she following us this whole time?

7
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,577
You.

8
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:51,162
Undo these spells.

9
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,080
Huh?

10
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,165
The spells I'm under!

11
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:55,333
Get to it!

12
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,211
W-What kind of spells are you under?

13
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,838
Can't you tell by looking?

14
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,132
You wield black magic, don't you?

15
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:04,092
At least clue me in
on what they're cast on

16
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,344
and what kind of magic they are.

17
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,099
There are two types of spells on me.

18
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:13,226
One's on my neck.

19
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:14,686
And the other...

20
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:15,603
Huh?

21
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,400
Is all over my body.

22
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:24,571
{\an8}Is she a beast-man?

23
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:25,613
{\an8}Yeah.

24
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:27,740
{\an8}I've seen one a long time ago.

25
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,743
An engineered beast-man.

26
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:34,581
Apparently, they're made with black magic,
mixing human and beast souls together.

27
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,335
Fine. I'll do what I can.

28
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:42,255
This...

29
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,966
{\an8}looks like it's written
in the Eastern script.

30
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:46,593
{\an8}What kind of spells are they?

31
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:48,970
{\an8}Can't you tell by looking?

32
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:52,682
{\an8}They activate when the spellcaster
goes without touching them for a while.

33
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:55,518
{\an8}Is the spellcaster the one called Maizuru?

34
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,353
{\an8}How much time do you have left?

35
00:02:57,437 --> 00:02:59,480
{\an8}What happens when you run out of time?

36
00:02:59,564 --> 00:03:00,440
{\an8}Who knows?

37
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:02,150
{\an8}You might want to hurry.

38
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,777
You don't want to die with me, do you?

39
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:07,822
I'll let you go once you undo the spells.

40
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,492
<i>The writing is peculiar.</i>

41
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,369
<i>But I have a feeling I can undo them.</i>

42
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:14,495
{\an8}Hey, you brat.

43
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:15,413
Huh?

44
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,873
Fetch me something to eat.

45
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:25,840
FIELD RATION PELLET

46
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:30,511
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

47
00:03:31,054 --> 00:03:34,015
If you shovel it in that fast,
you'll choke.

48
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,225
Shut up.

49
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:37,101
I'll prepare something hot for you.

50
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,603
Hey! Did I say you could move?

51
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:39,520
Whoa!

52
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:41,231
Don't underestimate--

53
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:46,569
{\an8}You need something to moisten your throat.

54
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:48,529
{\an8}I'll fix you something. That's all.

55
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,574
{\an8}If you try
to feed me monsters, I'll kill you.

56
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,409
Deal.

57
00:03:56,246 --> 00:04:00,250
I'm pretty sure I picked up some mushrooms
around where the Dryads were.

58
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:04,128
<i>They're starting to sprout
leg-like things.</i>

59
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,298
<i>Must be my imagination.</i>

60
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:10,343
<i>I'll set my pot on the magic circle,</i>

61
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:14,180
<i>melt some butter,
sauté some garlic,</i>

62
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,390
<i>and toss in the rice.</i>

63
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,393
<i>Then I'll add
the mushrooms and seasonings,</i>

64
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:20,979
<i>pour in some water,
and let it stew for a bit.</i>

65
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:32,907
<i>The fact that this is all I can make
makes me feel useless and pathetic.</i>

66
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:37,412
<i>At any rate, I can't stand the idea
of young ones going hungry.</i>

67
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,413
<i>But at least,</i>

68
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,665
I can throw in some cheese.

69
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:42,500
It's done.

70
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,169
RISOTTO WITH MUSHROOMS FROM A GRAVEYARD
AND CHEESE FROM ORCS

71
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,130
I'll put it here.

72
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,840
You think I'd eat that?

73
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:02,437
<i>This kid...</i>

74
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:05,189
<i>Her table manners</i>

75
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:06,482
<i>are terrible!</i>

76
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:08,693
Give me more!

77
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:12,488
{\an8}Is etiquette different
in the East or something?

78
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:15,783
{\an8}We never saw Shuro eating like that.

79
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,703
She simply had a poor upbringing.

80
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:20,747
Guess that's unfamiliar to you.

81
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:28,755
- Huh?
- Huh?

82
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:36,596
Why did you do that?

83
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:37,889
I hate mushrooms.

84
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,015
<i>She's picky!</i>

85
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:41,142
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

86
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:42,143
<i>Senshi...</i>

87
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:45,772
Your spoon.

88
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:49,025
Hold your spoon properly.

89
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:49,984
Hey!

90
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:51,986
If you come any closer, I'll kill you!

91
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,741
Hold your spoon the right way
and pick up what you threw on the floor.

92
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,493
- What'd you say?
- Hey!

93
00:05:58,576 --> 00:05:59,619
Don't!

94
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,246
It's risky to move
when I'm undoing your spell!

95
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,096
Hold your spoon like this.

96
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,806
W-Who cares how I hold it?

97
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,225
This way is easier for me!

98
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:24,018
I'm not surprised.

99
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:27,480
Having someone force you to hold a spoon
in an unfamiliar way must be annoying.

100
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:28,397
However--

101
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:29,732
Senshi, behind you!

102
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:34,028
Huh?

103
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:36,114
<i>I didn't feel anything.</i>

104
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:38,616
<i>Is this paper?</i>

105
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,743
Senshi, watch out!

106
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:48,668
That's a carving knife,
a type of knife used for cutting meat.

107
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,131
It's got a long, sharp blade
that can look pretty intimidating,

108
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,133
but it's thin and delicate.

109
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:59,512
If you wave it around like that,
what do you think is going to happen?

110
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:00,471
Senshi!

111
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:14,068
Just like that, you might not get
the most out of your tool,

112
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,779
leaving yourself at a disadvantage.

113
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:24,579
Senshi!

114
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:26,080
Now, Laios!

115
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:37,175
Are you hurt, cat girl?

116
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,678
I'm sorry for giving you a fright.

117
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,596
However,

118
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:46,100
there are right
and wrong ways to hold a tool.

119
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:48,561
I want you to think about
why that's the case.

120
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:51,647
{\an8}And why you shouldn't move
while a spell's being undone.

121
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:55,318
{\an8}If the spells had been nastier,
who knows what might've happened.

122
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,447
The food's gone cold.

123
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,115
I'll reheat it quick.

124
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:04,368
So?

125
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:06,704
Why were you coming after us?

126
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:12,668
All this time, I've been looking for a way
to break the curses on my body.

127
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:17,757
Turns out, these curses
were placed by black magic.

128
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,010
But I could never find anyone
who could wield black magic.

129
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:24,472
Until I crossed paths with that long-ears.

130
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:27,225
Black, I mean ancient magic
comes in all sorts.

131
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:29,852
My research is mainly about
drawing energy from another dimension--

132
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:30,770
Don't give me that!

133
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:33,022
I know you can do it!

134
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,650
I mean, you've done it before!

135
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:39,195
<i>You wielded black magic
to create that eerie half-beast creature!</i>

136
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:43,991
And you're all
trekking through this dungeon

137
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,701
to break the curse on that woman, right?

138
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:48,913
That means you know how to break curses!

139
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,415
In that case, you can free me too!

140
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,586
Get rid of this beast's soul
that's possessing me!

141
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,131
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:02,260
There's nothing I can do about that.

143
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:04,178
What?

144
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:07,139
<i>There's a lot we don't know
about the soul.</i>

145
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:09,433
<i>But it's often likened to an egg.</i>

146
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:13,145
<i>Normally, it's nestled inside
a shell we call flesh,</i>

147
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,815
<i>but once the flesh is broken,
the insides spill out</i>

148
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:17,400
<i>and can't be put back again.</i>

149
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:20,570
<i>This dungeon is under a spell</i>

150
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:23,406
<i>that forms a tough membrane
beneath the shell,</i>

151
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,033
<i>keeping the soul inside
even when the body is damaged.</i>

152
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:32,290
At the moment, you and Falin
have got two eggs inside one shell.

153
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,626
And once mixed together,

154
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,878
those souls can never go back
to their original form.

155
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,675
<i>I knew that, but hearing it
laid out like that hits differently.</i>

156
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,760
{\an8}What?

157
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:49,223
{\an8}If that's the case,
why press on with your journey?

158
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:55,438
One reason is
we can't just let my sister run wild.

159
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:58,190
She might kill the next adventurer
she crosses paths with.

160
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:00,109
Or get herself killed by them.

161
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,778
We want to do something
before that happens.

162
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:06,115
And if we return to the surface now,

163
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,367
we'll be apprehended
for dabbling in black magic.

164
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:11,579
Shuro will likely tell the Lord
of the Island about this incident.

165
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:13,748
But...

166
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:17,126
Does this mean I'm stuck like this?

167
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,086
No, listen to me!

168
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,007
I know this might sound weird,
but I'm honestly glad to have met you.

169
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,343
{\an8}I'm not sure what kind of monster
you're mixed with,

170
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:27,845
{\an8}but your behavior is just like a human's.

171
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,764
{\an8}And you're not out for blood either.

172
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:33,934
So, maybe even Falin,
once she's free from the dungeon's grip,

173
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:36,520
might be able to reclaim her true self.

174
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:40,274
Just realizing that makes me

175
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,568
so very happy right now.

176
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:44,278
Here.

177
00:10:44,862 --> 00:10:48,115
Maybe things didn't unfold
exactly as you'd hoped,

178
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,076
but why not look at it
from a positive angle,

179
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,827
like it was fate at work?

180
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,038
The lord of the dungeon

181
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,124
is way more skilled
with ancient magic than I am.

182
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:02,797
He might have some insights
on how to separate souls.

183
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,756
Hold up.

184
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,050
Are you trying to recruit me?

185
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:09,512
Either way, you can't make it back
to the surface by yourself.

186
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:12,181
Was your name Asebi or something?

187
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:14,225
That's just the name I go by.

188
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,226
Then...

189
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,310
It's Izutsumi.

190
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:18,270
My name is Izutsumi.

191
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:19,438
Don't forget.

192
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,452
Laios, how much longer are you going
to keep living like this?

193
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:34,870
Father.

194
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:37,081
It's about time
you started living a proper life.

195
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,960
I didn't let you go out there
just so you could go off slaying dragons.

196
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,586
Come back to the village!

197
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,422
But Falin's still...

198
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,298
Forget about her.

199
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,302
Do you really believe someone like you
can make it out there

200
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:53,806
{\an8}when you ran away from both school
and the army because you couldn't fit in?

201
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:57,309
You don't even have the knack
for exploring the dungeon.

202
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,645
Just like back when you were gold-peeling,

203
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:02,731
your comrades will deceive you
and take credit for your achievements.

204
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:05,734
Because you're clueless
when it comes to reading people.

205
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:07,987
It was the same with me.

206
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,157
You believed we were close friends,

207
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,950
but I've always loathed--

208
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:13,993
Would you let that go?

209
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:15,661
We've already talked it out.

210
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:17,371
Wait, hang on.

211
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:19,874
<i>Why are my parents here?</i>

212
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:22,126
<i>I haven't seen them in over a decade.</i>

213
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,003
<i>And where am I?</i>

214
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,629
<i>What was I up to?</i>

215
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,214
<i>I think I was...</i>

216
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:32,887
<i>Lately, Marcille</i>

217
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:35,681
<i>seemed kind of worn out.</i>

218
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:39,518
Marcille, we'll take care
of keeping watch tonight.

219
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:40,728
You rest.

220
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,146
Huh? But why?

221
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,397
Don't worry about me.

222
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:45,566
Come on. Just rest.

223
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:46,484
Hey!

224
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,402
Ugh, what are you doing?!

225
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:51,238
I'm not that tired, you know.

226
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:53,032
I'll be up in a bit.

227
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:54,742
I can't be the only one to...

228
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:59,747
<i>But before long, her quiet breathing
turned into distressed groans.</i>

229
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:02,833
What's the matter, Marcille?

230
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,460
This isn't something to take lightly.

231
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:05,544
Is it a monster?

232
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:07,796
Yeah, I think it's a Nightmare.

233
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,966
<i>They prey on humans in their sleep,
inflicting them with nightmares,</i>

234
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,551
<i>and feed on their emotions.</i>

235
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:16,138
If this goes on,
Marcille will weaken and die.

236
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,349
Wake up, Marcille!

237
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,101
Don't. If you force her awake,
you'll harm her soul.

238
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:26,565
When Shuro was possessed before,
Falin entered his dreams to rescue him.

239
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,068
Let's try that.

240
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,362
You're going to enter her dream?

241
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:34,323
Someone needs
to help her realize she's dreaming.

242
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:37,910
{\an8}Use the dreamer as a pillow and...

243
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,337
<i>Right. I was trying to help Marcille.</i>

244
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,923
{\an8}I'm inside my own dream!

245
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:54,093
The Nightmare got an easy bite out of me.

246
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:55,469
It's always like this.

247
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:57,721
They sure know how to hit where it hurts!

248
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,350
But now that I know it's just a dream,
I've got the upper hand.

249
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:04,270
Come forth, my mightiest servant!

250
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:12,236
<i>Now, I need to enter Marcille's dream.</i>

251
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:15,364
Since she's serving
as my pillow right now,

252
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,450
I'll have to dig down.

253
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:24,248
This is the beauty of dreams.

254
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,083
This only works inside
your own dream, though.

255
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,798
That was a close one.

256
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,426
That fall almost jolted me awake.

257
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:39,763
So this is what
Marcille's dream looks like.

258
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:42,892
Pretty cool.

259
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,143
Is someone there?

260
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:46,103
What are you doing?

261
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,939
This place is dangerous.
You need to get out fast.

262
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:51,817
Marcille?

263
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,736
W-Who are you?

264
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,321
It's me, Laios!

265
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:57,823
And we're inside your dream!

266
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:00,826
You need to wake up and...

267
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,785
A tremor?

268
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:04,413
It's coming!

269
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,415
W-We need to run!

270
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:07,583
What's coming?

271
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,959
Just follow me!

272
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:13,213
<i>It swallowed Papa and Pipi.</i>

273
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:14,798
<i>Papa and Pipi?</i>

274
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:17,718
<i>A dream about being chased, huh?</i>

275
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,304
<i>Those are pretty common, but nasty.</i>

276
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:22,473
<i>I remember Falin mentioning...</i>

277
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,893
Nightmares thrive on emotional scars.

278
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,104
Stressful events and trauma.

279
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:33,025
They trigger those memories
and give people nightmares.

280
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:37,196
So all we have to do
is shield their scars.

281
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,280
I see.

282
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:39,698
But...

283
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:42,284
It's dangerous, so don't try it.

284
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:44,244
All right. I got it!

285
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:46,622
I'll take it down for you!

286
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:49,249
{\an8}What are you doing? It's too risky!

287
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,918
{\an8}Don't worry.

288
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,753
I might not seem like it,
but I'm actually...

289
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:06,392
What in the world is that?

290
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:08,060
How should I know?

291
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:11,063
<i>Is that what Marcille's afraid of?</i>

292
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:13,732
<i>It's quite a bit over the top,</i>

293
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:16,318
<i>but it does look like
it'll be tough for me to take down.</i>

294
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:20,656
<i>It wouldn't be a threat if she realized
this was all just a dream, though.</i>

295
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,033
We've come far enough.

296
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,911
Nowhere is safe.

297
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:28,455
Nobody stands a chance against it.

298
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,500
Don't worry.

299
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,460
Let's think of a way
to take it down together.

300
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,172
<i>What is Marcille afraid of?</i>

301
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,591
<i>A monster, of course.</i>

302
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:42,302
<i>It crawls sluggishly,</i>

303
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,972
<i>has countless tentacles
and an insatiable hunger,</i>

304
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:46,932
<i>and looks disgusting.</i>

305
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:48,851
<i>Is it some kind of insect?</i>

306
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:52,396
<i>But bugs that size are pretty rare.</i>

307
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,857
<i>Bugs...</i>

308
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,108
<i>That's it!</i>

309
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:57,735
It's a Wurm!

310
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,611
It's a Wurm from the Dragon family!

311
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:02,614
Its legs and eyes have degenerated,
so it's more like a giant caterpillar.

312
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:05,367
It's voracious
and devours anything living!

313
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:07,369
It's weak to fire and light!

314
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:09,955
Pretty classy choice!

315
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:11,582
Huh?

316
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:14,585
When did it...

317
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:16,879
Hold on!

318
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,757
R-Run!

319
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,509
Did that thing touch you?

320
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:24,094
Just a brush.

321
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:25,012
Show me!

322
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:29,641
What's this?

323
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:40,027
<i>Damn.</i>

324
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,779
<i>I frightened her even more!</i>

325
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:44,031
<i>It'll only make the Nightmare stronger.</i>

326
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,287
<i>What a potent poison.</i>

327
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,956
<i>What happens if you die
in someone else's dream?</i>

328
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:57,127
<i>No, it wants us
to feel anxious and scared.</i>

329
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,046
<i>I have to lift Marcille's spirits.</i>

330
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:00,297
Don't worry!

331
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,508
You can use magic!

332
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:05,010
You can take that thing down
all by yourself!

333
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,054
Magic?

334
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,353
<i>The place is getting even more unstable.</i>

335
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:16,188
<i>Did I say something wrong?</i>

336
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:17,314
When...

337
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:21,235
When I tried to use magic to defeat it,

338
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:24,404
she ended up like this.

339
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:26,698
She?

340
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:29,201
Wait, is that Falin?

341
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:30,953
<i>I get it now.</i>

342
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:33,080
<i>Marcille feels guilty
about Falin's transformation</i>

343
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,040
<i>due to her resurrection magic.</i>

344
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:37,709
<i>If she tried
to defeat that thing, it means...</i>

345
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:40,295
<i>Marcille is afraid of death!</i>

346
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,548
I-It's coming back!

347
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,592
{\an8}Running won't solve anything.

348
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:47,553
{\an8}You have to face it head-on.

349
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:48,595
{\an8}What?

350
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,932
Don't worry.
There's nothing for you to fear!

351
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,852
In the dungeon, even if you die,
you can come back to life.

352
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:58,355
Even Falin is still alive
thanks to your resurrection magic.

353
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,649
And you're used to seeing corpses, right?

354
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:02,359
What?!

355
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,116
{\an8}It's pulling me in!

356
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,367
{\an8}No!

357
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,119
{\an8}It's only pulling me!

358
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,704
Grab my hand!

359
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,375
<i>It's not poison.</i>

360
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,128
<i>I'm aging at an incredible rate.</i>

361
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:23,630
W-Wait a minute, Marcille.

362
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:24,923
I need to catch my breath.

363
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,509
<i>Something's not right.</i>

364
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:30,262
<i>Is there a creature capable of this?</i>

365
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,723
<i>Maybe it's not even a creature at all.</i>

366
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,392
So you won't come along with me either?

367
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,353
No, I can run again after a short rest.

368
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:39,271
You're lying!

369
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:43,859
Everyone who ran with me gave up,
and they were all swallowed by that thing.

370
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:47,362
Papa, Pipi, Falin, everyone!

371
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:50,699
That's why I studied a lot of magic.

372
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:54,036
But if that's what turned Falin into this,

373
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,288
I don't know what to do.

374
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:00,709
Did your father pass away young?

375
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:04,421
At Papa's funeral, Mama told me

376
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:08,050
<i>that I run faster than everyone else.</i>

377
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,471
<i>That I'd have to watch
a lot of people go away.</i>

378
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:15,599
By the way, is Pipi a relative of yours?

379
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,683
Pipi's a bird.

380
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,809
<i>I see.</i>

381
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,605
<i>Marcille isn't afraid of death.</i>

382
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:25,025
<i>She's worried that those she cares about
will pass away before her.</i>

383
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:33,200
Marcille, calm down!

384
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:36,203
If you're scared,
it'll just empower that thing.

385
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:38,872
But what am I supposed to do?

386
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:40,082
I can't do anything!

387
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:41,708
No, you can!

388
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:44,211
You're incredible, Marcille!

389
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:46,713
I mean, just look at all these books!

390
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:49,299
There was nothing like that in my dream!

391
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,469
You've been working tirelessly
all this time!

392
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,055
Don't lose heart. Have faith in yourself!

393
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,349
You've got this, Marcille!

394
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,351
No, get up!

395
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:00,811
We have to run!

396
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:01,979
And besides,

397
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:04,731
{\an8}my magic isn't fully developed!

398
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:07,234
<i>If I had the same book he does,</i>

399
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:10,529
<i>I could use magic more effectively, but...</i>

400
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:12,864
Then wish for it!

401
00:21:12,948 --> 00:21:15,617
If you wish hard enough,
you can accomplish anything!

402
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:18,745
Don't be afraid!
You can do better next time!

403
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,372
Don't give up!

404
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:23,625
No!

405
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,627
No!

406
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,345
That's it, Marcille!

407
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:36,388
Do it!

408
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:50,235
That's how you use it?!

409
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:55,324
You're awake.

410
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,242
You were both groaning in your sleep.

411
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:58,368
Are you okay?

412
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,871
I don't really remember.

413
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:03,498
It was an exhausting dream, though.

414
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:09,212
She's falling back asleep!

415
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:11,381
No! Wake up, Marcille!

416
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,759
My dream?

417
00:22:14,343 --> 00:22:15,635
I don't remember much.

418
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:18,597
But I think it was a fun one.

419
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,307
Looks like it worked.

420
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,892
Did something happen?

421
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:23,518
Pass me your pillow.

422
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:24,519
Huh?

423
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:28,607
What are those?

424
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,025
Nightmares.

425
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:33,695
They hide in people's pillows
and give them bad dreams.

426
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:36,573
There are so many of them.

427
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:38,867
They must have been
nesting in your pillow for a while.

428
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,785
No way!

429
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:41,661
Senshi, are these edible?

430
00:22:41,745 --> 00:22:43,747
I've always been curious
about their flavor.

431
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,207
Yes, of course.

432
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,168
First, let's clean the gunk off.

433
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:52,047
If you soak them in hot water like this...

434
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:56,134
Nightmares, also known as Shen,

435
00:22:56,218 --> 00:22:58,011
are actually related to Dragons.

436
00:22:58,095 --> 00:23:00,055
If you look closely,
they're a bit Dragon-like.

437
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:01,431
You're kidding me.

438
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:05,268
<i>Place the Nightmares in melted butter,</i>

439
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:07,646
<i>add some wine, and cover with a lid.</i>

440
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:14,194
<i>Finally, drizzle a bit
of soy sauce over them,</i>

441
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:15,695
and it's done.

442
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:19,282
What's this?

443
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:21,451
That's me!

444
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:25,038
The dream that the Nightmares devoured
turned into a mirage.

445
00:23:25,122 --> 00:23:27,707
It's coming back to me.

446
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,750
Right,

447
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,836
I was running from something

448
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,504
<i>when a dog appeared.</i>

449
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:36,967
And we went on a treasure hunt together.

450
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,302
It was such a fun dream!

451
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:41,304
The dog seems a bit scruffy.

452
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:42,973
It looks dumb.

453
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:44,683
What's wrong, Laios?

454
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:48,854
I remember it being a silver wolf, but...

455
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,188
Never mind.

456
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,191
I'm glad if I helped in creating
a fun dream for her.
