00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,846
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:34,834
While you guys were turning
to stone, bleeding from your nose,

3
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,753
and getting engrossed in hunting for food,

4
00:01:38,295 --> 00:01:41,090
I managed to find some patterns
in the shifts of the dungeon.

5
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:43,592
It's not like I wanted
to be turned to stone.

6
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:44,802
Hear, hear!

7
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:47,346
The past three days
have been very productive!

8
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:48,472
Yeah, whatever.

9
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:51,600
One path gets blocked
and another one opens up.

10
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,477
It's basically this on repeat.

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,857
The number of doors, furniture,
and types of buildings stay the same.

12
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,359
A house never transforms into a graveyard.

13
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:03,863
The walls move in a clockwise spiral
at regular intervals.

14
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:07,449
The positions of the stone statues
and the directions they face are fixed.

15
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,368
Based on all that and more...

16
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,166
I remember this street.

17
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:18,002
That's the house where we ate the Dragon.

18
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,087
Chilchuck, you're a genius!

19
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:22,089
Well, it's all in a day's work.

20
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:25,843
But this street...

21
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:27,887
<i>Exactly.</i>

22
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,972
<i>It's where we lost Falin.</i>

23
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:32,892
<i>There was a pool of blood
and traces of something being dragged.</i>

24
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:33,851
<i>It's Falin!</i>

25
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:36,353
<i>If those two catch sight of it,
they'll get worked up for sure.</i>

26
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:38,147
<i>How am I going to make them stay calm?</i>

27
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,398
Laios, look!

28
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,775
What is this?

29
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:44,570
Listen! I get that there's a lot
to be concerned about,

30
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:47,448
but for now, let's focus
on getting back to the surface and...

31
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,283
Huh?

32
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:57,666
The Dragon's carcass was here, right?

33
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,877
It's vanished, without a trace.

34
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:06,050
But this crack in the wall must've been
made when the Red Dragon fell.

35
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:09,011
But even this crack is being repaired...

36
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,392
The magician's eye will be upon you.

37
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:19,688
Don't yell like that!

38
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:21,607
Just now, I saw...

39
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,487
I think it's mana sickness again.

40
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,655
Again?

41
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:32,117
Ever since I used healing magic,
I sometimes see and hear things.

42
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,494
You hear things?

43
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:35,496
Are you sure it's mana sickness?

44
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:36,830
What did you hear?

45
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:39,750
"The magician's eye will be upon you."

46
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,543
"The magician's eye"?

47
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:43,754
Could it be...

48
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:49,635
The sound of wings!

49
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:51,011
It's that Little Dragon!

50
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:52,137
We need to hide!

51
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:53,681
Hide where exactly?

52
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,766
This place is too exposed.

53
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:57,768
We've got to run, Marcille!

54
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,645
No, I know where to hide.

55
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:02,606
Inside the wall!

56
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:07,861
Come on, you two! Hurry!

57
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:09,154
Is this...

58
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:11,407
Another one of her spells?

59
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:30,801
Marcille, what kind of magic was that?

60
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,973
Cleaners?

61
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,391
What?

62
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:38,892
Dungeon Cleaners.

63
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,061
They're creatures, I think,

64
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:44,440
that keep the dungeon clean
and fix up any damages.

65
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:45,357
Exactly.

66
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:49,069
{\an8}I figured this wall
wasn't completely set yet.

67
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,447
Up until this point is the original wall,

68
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,741
and from here on are Cleaners.

69
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:54,950
Even the floor!

70
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:55,868
Check it out!

71
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:58,746
Even the wear and tear
and tiny scratches are being recreated.

72
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:01,123
You can't tell the difference by sight.

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,335
Ugh!

74
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:07,838
There are tiny things
crawling all over the floor!

75
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:08,839
Gross!

76
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:11,258
{\an8}They're all Cleaners.

77
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,595
{\an8}Any dungeon without them
would fall apart in no time.

78
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,097
They're not monsters and aren't harmful.

79
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,766
They are harmful.

80
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,102
These suckers often nibble on my tent.

81
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:27,983
<i>They break down anything
they think is in the way.</i>

82
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:31,862
<i>They must've come to eat the remains
of the Dragon and the explosion.</i>

83
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:34,573
They show up when the dungeon is damaged,

84
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:37,618
and their secretion prevents fires
from spreading and further collapses.

85
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:41,038
Then they start devouring
any scattered rubble.

86
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:42,372
They're not picky eaters.

87
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:46,210
Finally, they excrete secretions
to fill in the broken areas

88
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:48,837
and restore the dungeon
to its former state.

89
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:52,007
It's similar to how creatures heal.

90
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,509
All things considered,

91
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:56,595
monsters act like the immune system,
clearing out germs.

92
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:57,888
Who are you calling germs?

93
00:05:57,971 --> 00:06:00,599
Is that also magic at work?

94
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:01,892
Pretty cool, huh?

95
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,268
Good grief.

96
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:05,813
What's next, a magical digestive system?

97
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:09,483
I wonder what the dungeon
would eat in that case?

98
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:13,737
<i>Thank goodness the bloodstains are gone.</i>

99
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:15,447
{\an8}Hey.

100
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,783
{\an8}Let's get moving
before the dungeon shifts again.

101
00:06:17,866 --> 00:06:18,742
Right.

102
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:35,717
{\an8}Stairs!

103
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,012
{\an8}Finally, a way out.

104
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:42,558
Well then, how about
we start preparing that?

105
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,185
Good idea. Let's do that.

106
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:46,603
That?

107
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:48,605
Oh, you mean that.

108
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:59,158
Huh? By that, you meant a meal?

109
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,743
I don't think there are
any Tentacles on this level.

110
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:03,162
You should've said earlier!

111
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:04,955
You actually like that outfit, don't you?

112
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:05,914
I don't!

113
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:12,588
We've got so many ingredients,
I'm not sure what to make.

114
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,299
Maybe I can try using that.

115
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:17,342
Cook up some grain.

116
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:19,428
Is it the stuff from the third floor?

117
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:23,265
I was saving it
for when we ran out of food.

118
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:25,934
Chop up some Cockatrice meat,

119
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,811
Dryad fruit,

120
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:29,438
Mandrake fruit and leaves,

121
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:32,691
and depetrification herbs,

122
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,194
Season them and sauté.

123
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:38,697
Spread a layer of cooked grain
inside hollowed-out bricks.

124
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:41,950
Add the toppings
and heat them, brick and all.

125
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:43,952
And...

126
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,829
Huh? What's that?

127
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,706
A Cockatrice egg.

128
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,960
I brought one along,

129
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:54,463
but it's been a bit tricky to use.

130
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:59,718
Finally, pour on the egg sauce and

131
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,136
{\an8}it's ready.

132
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,722
{\an8}STONE-BAKED COCKATRICE
CHICKEN AND EGG WITH SAUCE

133
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,516
Wow, what is this?

134
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,642
It looks delicious!

135
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:11,480
<i>If I'd stayed petrified,
would they have used me to make this dish?</i>

136
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:18,362
The scorched grain is nice!

137
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,406
Try digging your spoon into the dish.

138
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:28,372
I used bricks made from Dungeon Cleaners.

139
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:30,832
So we can even eat the dish?

140
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:34,169
Thanks, Senshi!

141
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,008
What does it taste like?

142
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:42,344
At first, it tastes like dirt.

143
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:43,929
But as you savor it,

144
00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:47,224
it's like this magical blend
of green caterpillar, iron, and lemon.

145
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,810
You're just comparing it to other things.

146
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:52,813
There's no other way to describe it.

147
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:55,732
Are you sure it's safe
to eat magical creatures?

148
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:58,402
It might make you hear things
and bleed from your nose again.

149
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,612
I wonder what's with those hallucinations.

150
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:04,741
When we get back to town,
you should really see a doctor

151
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:05,659
for your head.

152
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:06,660
A doctor?

153
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,037
Do you think it's some kind of illness?

154
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:17,170
Is this another hallucination?

155
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:19,047
Are you guys seeing this?

156
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:21,675
I-I see it.

157
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:24,678
I mean, we're...

158
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:26,888
under attack!

159
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,812
Huh? What on earth?

160
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,439
It's just frog skin.

161
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:40,068
Looks like these horns
are just decorations on a helmet.

162
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,903
A child?

163
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:46,950
Some monsters
disguise themselves as humans.

164
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:51,330
Let's try killing one to see
if they'll reveal their true colors--

165
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:53,248
Don't, Maizuru.

166
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:58,378
I know them.

167
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,630
- Shuro!
- Shuro!

168
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:02,758
{\an8}Shuro, long time no see!

169
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:06,511
What a pleasant surprise
to run into you here!

170
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:08,263
Did you lose weight?

171
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,648
Thanks, Shuro!

172
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:21,068
Glad to see you're doing well.

173
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:22,903
Goodness! How forward of him!

174
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,488
Oh, let me introduce you.

175
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:26,448
This is Senshi.

176
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:29,910
Senshi, meet Shuro,
our former party member.

177
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:31,870
{\an8}Shuro? Who's that?

178
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:34,039
{\an8}They probably mean Young Master Toshiro.

179
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,667
Toshuro?

180
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,129
Let's continue
our conversation sitting down.

181
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,215
We were just having a meal.

182
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:45,676
Would you all like to...

183
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:49,763
Huh? You've got quite a big group!

184
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,182
Hey, Kabru.

185
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,350
Is that...

186
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:56,937
Nice to meet you.

187
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,065
You're Laios, aren't you?

188
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,984
Yeah.

189
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:04,319
Nice to meet you.

190
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:09,825
How long has it been?

191
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,577
Hey, Kabru.

192
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:14,413
It's them, right?

193
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,206
The ones who stole our stuff.

194
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:17,749
What will you do?

195
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,710
Nothing.

196
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:21,628
Huh?

197
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:23,839
What did we come all the way here for?

198
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,053
I wanted to meet them.

199
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:31,388
Huh?

200
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:34,599
<i>I doubt asking them
about the treasure will help.</i>

201
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,853
<i>He didn't look guilty even when he saw us.</i>

202
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:41,898
{\an8}Either he doesn't remember,
or we're mistaken.

203
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:44,693
{\an8}Or maybe the treasure itself was a trap.

204
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:46,361
{\an8}Or maybe all of them.

205
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:48,280
{\an8}Are you saying
we made this trip for nothing?

206
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:49,489
{\an8}Don't be hasty.

207
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:51,158
{\an8}Give me a bit more time.

208
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,411
Don't you want to find out
how they managed to get here

209
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:57,831
and what they plan to do in the future?

210
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:02,586
So, you've been
on this level for a while now?

211
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:03,545
Yeah.

212
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,797
<i>We kept going around in circles,</i>

213
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,799
<i>and when we got out,
we were back at the entrance.</i>

214
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,552
<i>We got lost a lot too.</i>

215
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:13,805
But Chilchuck
found patterns in the shifts,

216
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:16,141
and that's how we finally made it here.

217
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:17,058
I see.

218
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:20,061
Anyway, Shuro, you...

219
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:24,483
You lech!

220
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,193
Are they the connections you mentioned?

221
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:27,319
Lucky you!

222
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,280
They're just retainers.

223
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:32,782
{\an8}They're quite skilled, though.

224
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:35,911
{\an8}I'm sorry for leaving the party.

225
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,956
{\an8}But when I realized Falin
was missing up on the surface,

226
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,046
I thought this was the best way
to get back into the dungeon and find her.

227
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:48,340
Forgive me.

228
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:50,342
It's fine. There was no other way.

229
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:54,554
But I'm surprised you went back
into the dungeon right after that.

230
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,223
Wasn't it a little rash?

231
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:59,684
What would you have done
if someone got hurt again?

232
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:03,104
Just so you know,

233
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:07,359
the four of us
even defeated the Red Dragon!

234
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:08,360
What?!

235
00:13:08,944 --> 00:13:10,070
The Red Dragon?

236
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,864
A-And what about her?

237
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:17,369
Shuro!

238
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:18,286
Young Master!

239
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:22,415
{\an8}I beg you, please eat and get some sleep!

240
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,543
{\an8}At this rate, your body will break down!

241
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,753
You're pushing yourself that hard?

242
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:29,506
Look at how gaunt he is.
You should've noticed.

243
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:33,134
You should get food and sleep, you know.

244
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,805
I don't have time for that.

245
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:40,684
{\an8}Shuro, eating isn't something
you do when you have time.

246
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:43,895
It's only after having sleep and food

247
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:47,107
that creatures can
finally do what they want.

248
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,026
Have something to eat.

249
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:53,071
While you do, I'll fill you in
on what happened.

250
00:13:55,156 --> 00:13:56,658
Fine.

251
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:59,911
Can you prepare something, Maizuru?

252
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:05,584
A meal! Prepare a meal!

253
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,961
Tade, go fetch some water!

254
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:09,087
On it!

255
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,799
Hien, Benichidori, get ready to cook rice.

256
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,885
Asebi, you...

257
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:19,306
guard the Young Master.

258
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,725
I don't want anything strange
mixed into the food.

259
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:24,728
Well then, I'll get the fire going.

260
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,479
You are considerate.

261
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,064
I'll leave it to you, dwarf.

262
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,484
A meal, a meal!

263
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:33,486
This group is too big.

264
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,740
It's not safe for so many people
to gather in one place.

265
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:38,909
Let's split up into three.

266
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,745
In that case,

267
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,122
Rin, dwarf,

268
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:45,582
frog woman!

269
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,499
What?!

270
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,836
Everyone who can use magic,
put up a barrier.

271
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:53,465
Make sure no monsters disturb
the Young Master while he eats.

272
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:57,385
Let's work together, young lady.

273
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,220
R-Right.

274
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:00,972
Okay then,

275
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:03,099
Shuro, let's step away too.

276
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,518
I'll give you a quick rundown.

277
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:06,978
I'll help support him.

278
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:07,896
Thanks.

279
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:10,273
There's so much to do!

280
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:14,277
<i>In this case,
who's more dangerous if left alone?</i>

281
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,656
Monsters! Delicious! Awesome!

282
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,992
Monsters! Cook! Eat!

283
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:22,118
Eat this!

284
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:23,662
Die.

285
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:26,414
{\an8}Senshi, I'm coming with you!

286
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,430
Hey, aren't you overdoing it?

287
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:43,556
The smoke...

288
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:47,519
After this meal,
I must make him take a bath.

289
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:48,561
<i>Here?</i>

290
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:51,106
Okay, Shuro, sit here.

291
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:53,525
Never mind that,
just tell me what happened.

292
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:57,320
After you and Namari left, we--

293
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:58,655
Just give me the gist.

294
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:03,827
We defeated the Red Dragon,
retrieved Falin, and revived her.

295
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,454
But on our way back,
we were attacked by the lunatic magician,

296
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:07,747
and we lost her.

297
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:11,084
There was nothing more
we could do on our own,

298
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:14,671
{\an8}so we decided to head back
to the surface and ask for backup.

299
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:16,381
{\an8}But we got lost and...

300
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:20,301
But I'm glad we
crossed paths with you, Shuro!

301
00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:22,220
Will you help us out?

302
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:27,308
Um, can I ask something?

303
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:32,188
The lunatic magician is the one
who created this dungeon, right?

304
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,442
<i>There are rumors and whispers about him,</i>

305
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:38,111
<i>but no one who's seen him
has ever returned.</i>

306
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,280
How can you be sure it was him?

307
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,865
Huh?

308
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:44,617
Well, he sounded and acted like it.

309
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:47,871
And how did you manage to escape?

310
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:49,330
It was thanks to Marcille...

311
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,876
The mage in our party protected us.

312
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,127
How exactly?

313
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,837
Um...

314
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,466
Magic isn't my area of expertise,
so I'm not sure.

315
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:01,593
I see.

316
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:05,597
I have a question too.

317
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:15,190
Why were you munching on a brick?

318
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,691
Huh?

319
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,401
Oh, it's not what it seems.

320
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:19,694
That wasn't a brick.

321
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:22,363
It was part of a wall
made from Dungeon Cleaners.

322
00:17:22,947 --> 00:17:26,367
We left all our food
and money behind, right?

323
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:31,206
So to get down into the dungeon faster,
we fed on monsters along the way.

324
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,506
That...

325
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:43,635
is just hilarious!

326
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:44,552
Huh?

327
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:46,763
What was the tastiest thing
you've eaten so far?

328
00:17:46,846 --> 00:17:48,014
You want to know?

329
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:49,265
That's a tough one.

330
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:51,184
{\an8}Kelpie, Living Armor...

331
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:53,269
{\an8}No, it's got to be the Red Dragon!

332
00:17:53,353 --> 00:17:56,231
{\an8}You ate the Red Dragon
that ate your sister?

333
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:57,482
{\an8}Yeah.

334
00:17:57,565 --> 00:18:00,151
Living Armor, though.
Are there any edible parts?

335
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:01,778
That's a good question!

336
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:04,989
Actually, it's a colony of mollusks
wearing a shell and...

337
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:06,282
Here, check out this sword.

338
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,035
The Cleaners are trying to eat Kensuke!

339
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,037
You just can't be too careful!

340
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,915
By the way, if you're interested
in monster cuisine,

341
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:15,500
I'd be happy to treat you anytime.

342
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,710
Wow, I'd love that!

343
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:20,922
<i>Crap. This guy will actually
take me up on it.</i>

344
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,552
So after she...

345
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:29,389
After Falin was revived,
was she safe the last time you saw her?

346
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:31,182
Yeah.

347
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:32,892
Any idea where she might be?

348
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:36,020
There are plenty of places
to hide on this level,

349
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:38,189
but most of them are the orcs' base camps.

350
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:40,900
Oh, you don't have to worry about them.

351
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:41,860
What?

352
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:44,946
What did they taste like?

353
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,030
No!

354
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:49,117
It's a long story,
but we're cooperating with them now.

355
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,370
Cooperating with them?

356
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:55,582
<i>Has he forgotten that killing them
is our duty as adventurers?</i>

357
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,084
Anyway, about Falin's whereabouts,

358
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:01,087
she might be somewhere
lower than this level.

359
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:04,048
She could have been taken there.

360
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,593
{\an8}Taken? Why?

361
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:08,261
{\an8}Um...

362
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,556
{\an8}<i>Is it safe to tell Shuro?</i>

363
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:14,976
Would you mind if I talked to him alone?

364
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,103
Sure, I'll step out.

365
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:26,112
So?

366
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,997
Field ration pellets aren't bad,
but having them every day?

367
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,709
Sometimes, you need something
warm in your belly.

368
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:40,877
I agree.

369
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,048
A meal should be more than
about filling the stomach.

370
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:47,091
I see you have sense, dwarf.

371
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:50,386
The Young Master
was often sick as a child.

372
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,515
He also had a small appetite,
which worried everyone.

373
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,812
<i>But he always had a hearty appetite
for whatever I made him.</i>

374
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:03,107
<i>Even during missions,
I was often sent to the kitchen.</i>

375
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:07,320
He was such a well-behaved child,
it made me concerned.

376
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:12,033
This is the first time
he's ever made a selfish request.

377
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:13,701
Please, Maizuru.

378
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:16,120
There's someone I want to save.

379
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:18,248
Lend me your aid.

380
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,585
I never imagined he'd become

381
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:25,505
infatuated with a Northern girl
on his training journey.

382
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:27,799
How do I convince him to move on?

383
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:30,301
You want him to move on?

384
00:20:30,385 --> 00:20:34,097
I've been tasked by the lord
to care for the Young Master.

385
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,808
I can't let my emotions
dictate my actions.

386
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:40,311
Then why are you doing what you're doing?

387
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:45,400
If you have preserved foods,
you don't have to bother with cooking.

388
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:50,571
I know why he had an appetite
for your cooking only.

389
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:53,908
I know what you put into them.

390
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:54,826
Huh?

391
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:57,787
It was love.

392
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:01,833
What is that supposed to mean?

393
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,668
Were you trying to be clever?

394
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:09,007
But yes, I suppose
it's a little too late now.

395
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:11,592
Depending on how things turn out,

396
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:14,095
perhaps I can speak on his behalf.

397
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:15,972
{\an8}TSUGUYOSHI NAKAMOTO

398
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:17,098
{\an8}TOSHITSUGU NAKAMOTO

399
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:18,683
{\an8}NOW, TOSHIRO NAKAMOTO

400
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:19,892
{\an8}FALIRO NAKAMOTO

401
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:21,853
{\an8}It's using different art materials!

402
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:24,731
{\an8}I don't think that's likely just yet.

403
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:27,608
Good. This will do.

404
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:29,027
{\an8}It's ready.

405
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,612
{\an8}AN EASTERN MEAL

406
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:35,616
Now then, let us serve it while it's hot!

407
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:40,496
What are you two doing here?

408
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,457
They wanted to talk privately.

409
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:45,835
Young Master, I'm coming in.

410
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:48,046
Young Master!

411
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:50,798
What happened?

412
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:53,843
Did this man try something?

413
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,722
Well? What happened?!

414
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:00,058
Sorry. We don't know.

415
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:03,019
Black magic.

416
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:07,899
This man used black magic
to revive a woman using monster flesh.

417
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:09,150
Black...?

418
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:13,029
How could you?

419
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:15,406
Do you even realize what you've done?

420
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,950
Anyone involved with black magic,

421
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:21,913
no matter their motives
or degree of magic, is a serious criminal!

422
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:24,707
They're locked up
in the dark until they die,

423
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,459
and even their corpses never return.

424
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:30,755
If the elves of the west find out,
who knows what will happen to her?

425
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:34,008
{\an8}That is, if word
gets out from this dungeon.

426
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:37,512
{\an8}And I know you will
never tell anyone about this.

427
00:22:39,263 --> 00:22:40,139
Right?

428
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:46,729
It was the only way.

429
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,773
Please understand, Shuro.

430
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,027
<i>Black magic?</i>

431
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:56,114
<i>This is way worse than I thought.</i>

432
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:57,490
<i>What's going to happen now?</i>

433
00:23:20,888 --> 00:23:23,015
Lord Delgal...

434
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:27,061
I must find him.
