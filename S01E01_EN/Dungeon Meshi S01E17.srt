1
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,858
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,769
Really, though.

3
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,565
There's nothing more horrifying
than black magic.

4
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:49,110
Was bringing this person back
worth going down that path?

5
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,612
It's only natural for Shuro to be furious.

6
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:55,533
Using shady methods
like that to resurrect someone?

7
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,368
That's just risky.

8
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,079
Letting her stay dead
would've been better for her--

9
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,122
Enough!

10
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,208
I understand your point,

11
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,544
so please stop.

12
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:10,590
Sorry.

13
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,552
Shuro, deep down, you probably know

14
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:19,515
that if you were in his shoes,
you'd have done the same thing.

15
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,850
I know that!

16
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,895
But his attitude is just too much!

17
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,938
We fed on monsters!

18
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,566
I think my favorite is the Red Dragon
because of the memories.

19
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,484
Check this out! It's a monster sword!

20
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:34,322
We may have used black magic,
but you won't tell anyone, right?

21
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:39,202
Anyway, I have no idea
what's going on in your head.

22
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,746
I doubt I'll ever understand.

23
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:43,748
So I can't help you.

24
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:45,750
Laios! Senshi!

25
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,418
We've got trouble!

26
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,630
A group of monsters
is attacking the cooking crew and…

27
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,424
What have you done?

28
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,636
I told him everything
that's happened so far.

29
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:58,638
Everything?!

30
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,806
I thought that Shuro would understand.

31
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,808
Shuro's the last person
you should have told!

32
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:03,726
I figured.

33
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,311
Is this on me?

34
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,772
Did I make the wrong call?

35
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,149
Don't beat yourself up.

36
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,276
He's just a little tired.

37
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,739
<i>I have a lot of respect for him.</i>

38
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,534
<i>He's helped me out countless times
on our adventures.</i>

39
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,288
<i>He told me tales of foreign lands</i>

40
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,916
<i>when all I've known
was my homeland and this island.</i>

41
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,544
<i>Shuro's always been cool-headed and smart.</i>

42
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,257
For him to explode like that,

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,051
I must've really messed up.

44
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,972
It'd be a shame
if our friendship ended like this…

45
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,814
Harpies.

46
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,319
This is getting us nowhere.

47
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,237
Asebi!

48
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,530
Let's go, you three!

49
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,745
Laios told Shuro everything
that's happened so far.

50
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,081
What? Is that why the air is so tense?

51
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,208
Shuro's furious.

52
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,209
What do we do?

53
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,003
If the story gets to the surface, we…

54
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:15,006
I know! I know, but…

55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,510
It looks like the ninjas
are handling things just fine.

56
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,179
Anyway, who else knows?

57
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:23,431
Four people for now.

58
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,599
Shuro and two of his retainers,

59
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,269
and that curly-haired guy.

60
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:34,775
He's the guy whose party
was wiped out by Treasure Bugs, right?

61
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,069
What's he doing here?

62
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:38,237
Who knows?

63
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,907
Maybe he's after
whoever stole their loot and food.

64
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,243
W-We have to clear that up!

65
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:48,164
The loot was just Treasure Bugs
and the food was drenched and ruined!

66
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,623
You idiot!

67
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,251
The bigger problem
is your use of black magic.

68
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,962
Shuro is angry, but he's not a concern.

69
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,883
He's just ticked off
we put Falin in danger.

70
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,344
But I'm not sure about the others.

71
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:06,265
By the way, how much evidence
is left of you using black magic?

72
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,686
The magic circle
got erased by the Cleaners,

73
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,274
but there might be trouble if they check
Falin's body and my staff too closely.

74
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,401
We need to torch your staff right now!

75
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,569
Wait a minute!

76
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,114
If they're already onto us that much,
burning my staff won't make a difference.

77
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:23,991
Huh?

78
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,536
Over there, look!

79
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,999
What's that monster?

80
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,042
A Harpy?

81
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,418
No.

82
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,105
What?

83
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,064
No.

84
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,565
No.

85
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,566
How?

86
00:05:58,526 --> 00:05:59,568
Falin…

87
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:02,947
It can't be.

88
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:05,991
No.

89
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:08,953
What on earth?

90
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,585
<i>It's so cool!</i>

91
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,881
<i>But it's a little too greedy.</i>

92
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,342
<i>It's got wings, feathers, and scales too.</i>

93
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,301
Falin!

94
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,387
Do you recognize me?

95
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,847
Knock it off, Marcille!

96
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,098
Falin!

97
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,435
-Holm! Rin! Prepare for battle!
-Falin!

98
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,353
-R-Right!
-Right.

99
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,689
-Laios, Shuro! What's the plan?
-Falin!

100
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,815
Tell us what to do!

101
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,192
Inutade, don't hurt her!

102
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,694
Try to restrain her!

103
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,195
Uh. Huh?

104
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,531
No, Young Master. Run--

105
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,761
So, I need to restrain her.

106
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,638
Restrain her without hurting her.

107
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,223
Restrain her without hurting her?

108
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,655
Can you do it, Holm?

109
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:27,948
Y-Yeah.

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,367
All right.

111
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:31,285
Come out.

112
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,100
Falin!

113
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,977
A-An Undine?

114
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,812
Are you controlling that?

115
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,356
Please make it stop!

116
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,441
She's just confused.

117
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,236
Give me a break.

118
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:08,113
You don't care how many people die

119
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,699
if you can protect someone
dear to you, is that it?

120
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,702
That thing isn't "her."

121
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,579
It's just a monster!

122
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,086
<i>Ludeloes Arnbite.</i>

123
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,595
Oh, Marillier…

124
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,264
It can even cast spells?

125
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,154
No, Kuro!

126
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,656
Don't, you fool! Stay hidden!

127
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:54,660
Falin…

128
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,625
Out of my way!

129
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,378
<i>Andarses Orbis!</i>

130
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,854
<i>Monsters are dangerous.</i>

131
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,189
<i>Damn it, Kensuke!</i>

132
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,149
<i>Never trust a monster…</i>

133
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,738
Forgive me, Falin.

134
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,408
I wish I could've
switched places with you.

135
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,419
My big brother, Laios.

136
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,723
Falin!

137
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,683
The lungs, kidneys,

138
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,560
and the heart!

139
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,406
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

140
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,619
Can you stand?

141
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,663
I'm sorry I hesitated.

142
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,623
You're right.

143
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,249
My sister's soul

144
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,294
is probably under the control
of the lord of the dungeon now.

145
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,091
But if we kill her,
the lunatic magician will show up again.

146
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,677
For now, we need to get out of here.

147
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,220
But--

148
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,314
Falin!

149
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,317
Hey!

150
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,365
You monster!

151
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:00,160
<i>Ludeloes Ejectulm Hemtum.</i>

152
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,121
This spell…

153
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,123
Everyone, stay close to me!

154
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,214
Essiet!

155
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,244
She might return.

156
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,163
Let's get the wounded inside the barrier.

157
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,206
And the dead…

158
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,875
What should we do?

159
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,502
I'll resurrect them.

160
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,671
I can't revive everyone, though.

161
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,507
Should I gather the bodies?

162
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,843
No, don't move them.

163
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,429
We can't waste a drop of shed blood.

164
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,476
Where's the monster?!

165
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,769
It bolted. We're safe now.

166
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,521
Who's next?

167
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:10,439
Wait.

168
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,524
Bring back that woman first.

169
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,028
Why me?

170
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,948
You seemed to be a powerful mage.

171
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,868
So I thought you could use
healing and resurrection magic.

172
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,205
He can't heal everyone alone.

173
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:30,375
You helped us get here,
so this is the least we can do.

174
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,710
So now I owe you.

175
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,879
My guess is
you're after a different spell.

176
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,881
Never mind.

177
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,216
Let us get this done quickly.

178
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,302
Um, I can use
basic resurrection magic too.

179
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,220
No.

180
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,514
Don't you lay a finger on them.

181
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,267
I can't let you use any more black magic.

182
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,020
I-I wouldn't do that.

183
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,605
Then what was that?

184
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,649
Why did she look like that?

185
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,985
It's because you used the Dragon's flesh
and black magic on her!

186
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,029
No! That can't be!

187
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,114
The magic didn't have that kind of power.

188
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,701
B-But it's possible that

189
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,539
the Red Dragon's soul
was under some spell.

190
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,291
And Falin's soul merged with the Dragon's,

191
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,169
and the lunatic magician
transformed her into that creature.

192
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,380
Shuro?

193
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,465
I'm handing Marcille over
to the elves of the west.

194
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,426
I can't kill that thing.

195
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,762
But I can't let it roam free either.

196
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,516
I want to free her soul from the dungeon

197
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,685
and let her rest in peace at least.

198
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,520
But…

199
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,730
The elves will know how to do that.

200
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,776
Confess everything
to the elves of the west.

201
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,444
No, Shuro.

202
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,280
There has to be another way.

203
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,614
Give me a break!

204
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,783
What have you been doing until now?

205
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,660
Another way?

206
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,786
What's your plan?

207
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,830
Are you going to keep resurrecting her

208
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,457
with different monster parts
until she's back to normal?

209
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,501
Go on, tell me!

210
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,753
What are you going to do?

211
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,505
You have an idea, don't you?

212
00:13:58,589 --> 00:13:59,881
Tell me!

213
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,681
We'll defeat the lunatic magician!

214
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:12,144
That Red Dragon
was clearly following orders.

215
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:16,106
Who else but the magician who created
this dungeon could command it?

216
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:20,360
So, we'll take down the magician
and rewrite his orders!

217
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,071
I'm not familiar with this sort of thing,

218
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,490
but Marcille should know how!

219
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,284
That's why I won't let you take her!

220
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,953
I've had enough!

221
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:34,333
Are you really going to use black magic
to fix a problem caused by black magic?

222
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,752
Why don't you start
taking things seriously for once?

223
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,093
Uh… sorr--

224
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,521
It's true I'm not the most skilled,

225
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,107
and you're stronger than most adventurers.

226
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,986
But here's what I know.

227
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,864
We've been getting
proper meals three times a day

228
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,491
and good sleep too.

229
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,284
That makes us more serious than you!

230
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,328
Listen to me!

231
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:16,708
We will take down the lunatic magician
and rescue Falin, no matter what!

232
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,378
Shuro, you go back to the surface.

233
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,381
Eat, bathe, and rest!

234
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,594
Huh? What was that?

235
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,848
Shut up!

236
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,103
The fight isn't over yet.

237
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,856
If that's your plan, I have one of my own.

238
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,899
Plan?

239
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,360
Laios!

240
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,486
Listen up.

241
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,446
For a long time now,

242
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,658
I couldn't stand your guts.

243
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,161
Because you were thoughtless, dense,

244
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,621
<i>and always had the worst timing!</i>

245
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,540
Hey, tell me more
about those foreign lands!

246
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,959
Are you two eating together? Count me in!

247
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,086
We're friends now, right?

248
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,256
<i>It was even worse
because you meant no harm!</i>

249
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,550
Why don't I just end you here,

250
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,884
take Marcille, and--

251
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,594
Well, you should've told me sooner!

252
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,596
Why were you keeping quiet until now

253
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,642
if you couldn't stand me and thought
I was dense and had terrible timing?

254
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:19,146
I was dropping hints
that most people would've picked up on!

255
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,524
You should've made
more of an effort to notice!

256
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,525
How could I?

257
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,029
You were the first friend
I made on this island,

258
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,823
and I was too excited to realize!

259
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,618
See, that's another thing
I can't stand about you!

260
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,704
You act all honest

261
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,831
but end up stressing people out!

262
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,333
How was I supposed to know?

263
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,253
You never speak up and you don't even eat!

264
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,548
What's the point of having a mouth?

265
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,300
Shut up, you moron!

266
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,595
You haven't put in
half the effort Marcille has.

267
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,805
We don't have time for this.

268
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,640
It's a childish squabble.

269
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,393
I must have raised him wrong.

270
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,521
Seven dead, including myself,

271
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,232
one in critical condition,
and three missing.

272
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,653
The gnome and I will resurrect them,
but we're low on blood.

273
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,282
Senshi, can you gather
the scattered ingredients?

274
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:13,909
Sure.

275
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,578
I can use basic resurrection magic too.

276
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,455
You stay out of this.

277
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,045
Heal the wounded and find the missing.

278
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,714
If you try anything suspicious,
I'll cut you down on the spot.

279
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,825
See, Shuro?

280
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,245
Right now, I'm better fed than you are.

281
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,579
That's why I'm stronger!

282
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,373
D-Damn it.

283
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,721
It's good.

284
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,475
Young Master, we've resurrected everyone.

285
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,145
When do you wish to depart?

286
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,107
No, prepare the return magic.

287
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,191
We're heading back up.

288
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,026
Are you sure?

289
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,863
Asebi is still missing.

290
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,072
She probably ran off.

291
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:34,990
Let her be.

292
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,702
Please forgive our inadequacy.

293
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,120
No.

294
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,497
You did your best.

295
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,499
Thank you.

296
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,585
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

297
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,008
I'm returning to my homeland.

298
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,969
I'll never set foot on this island again.

299
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,348
I'll report what happened
to the Lord of the Island.

300
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,517
I see.

301
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,687
I wish I could've returned with Falin.

302
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,773
What was her answer to your proposal?

303
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,774
I don't know.

304
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,403
She said she needed time
to think about it.

305
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,530
I was waiting for her answer.

306
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,791
<i>There's no woman
more fascinating than her.</i>

307
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,630
<i>I loved her voice, the way she thought,</i>

308
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,716
<i>and her smile.</i>

309
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:42,015
But I never actually
brought any of this up with her.

310
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,310
I wish I had told her sooner.

311
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,189
Wait, so he just popped
the question out of nowhere?

312
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,440
That's scary.

313
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,234
From where he comes from, it's normal.

314
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,820
I see. Well, I'll pass on
your words to Falin.

315
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,826
That's the part about you

316
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,163
that I envy.

317
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,711
Kabru, you were a big help.

318
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,129
I didn't do much.

319
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,048
My attack ended up being useless.

320
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,884
No, it helped me notice
a couple of things.

321
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,219
Like what?

322
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,305
The places you stabbed
would've been fatal for a human,

323
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,224
but not for my sister.

324
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,686
This means either that
she doesn't have vital organs there,

325
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,437
or she has more somewhere else.

326
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:34,901
A bunch of monsters like the Basilisk,
Cerberus, and Scylla have multiple brains.

327
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,195
It's pretty common in Chimera types.

328
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,031
<i>His pupils are dilated.</i>

329
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,284
<i>He must really love monsters.</i>

330
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,703
<i>So his knowledge is his weapon.</i>

331
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,455
<i>He says he'll defeat the lunatic magician.</i>

332
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:50,917
<i>There are plenty of adventurers
more skilled than him,</i>

333
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,087
<i>but none with his level
of knowledge and motivation.</i>

334
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,465
<i>This guy might just pull it off.</i>

335
00:20:58,967 --> 00:20:59,843
<i>But</i>

336
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,054
<i>what happens after he defeats
the lord of the dungeon?</i>

337
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,432
<i>They say whoever
takes down the lunatic magician</i>

338
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,851
<i>will gain everything in the kingdom.</i>

339
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,148
<i>What if that means becoming
the next lord of the dungeon?</i>

340
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:18,695
<i>What will he do with this city built
by black magic and all its monsters</i>

341
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,113
<i>when he inherits them?</i>

342
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,241
<i>Will he quietly seal the dungeon?</i>

343
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,702
Aren't you hungry?

344
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,786
Huh?

345
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:45,638
HARPY EGG OMELET

346
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,308
What's this?

347
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,727
It's an omelet made from a Harpy egg.

348
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,190
Senshi found an egg earlier.

349
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,525
You seemed interested in monster cuisine,

350
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,110
so have one.

351
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,116
<i>Mother!</i>

352
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,619
<i>I'd rather die than eat it!</i>

353
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,954
<i>What do I do? How do I get out of this?</i>

354
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,083
<i>No, maybe I have no choice
but to kill him now.</i>

355
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,667
<i>Not now!</i>

356
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,752
I'll try one!

357
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,087
<i>Typical of Kabru.</i>

358
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,465
<i>He'll do anything to win someone's favor.</i>

359
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,092
<i>What a nice guy.</i>

360
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,607
The return magic is ready.

361
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,276
No one is injured, yes?

362
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,736
Beyond this portal is the surface.

363
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,530
If you die there, we can't bring you back.

364
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,448
To be honest,

365
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,410
I think you'll die before you
even get to the lunatic magician.

366
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,038
But if you do manage to survive,

367
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,792
but can't make it back to the surface
because of black magic,

368
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,044
ring this bell.

369
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,297
It'll resonate with its twin far away.

370
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,552
I'll send an escort
to help you flee to the east.

371
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:08,346
Don't die.

372
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:10,807
Thanks.

373
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:13,685
Laios,

374
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:15,436
I'm glad we got to chat.

375
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,313
That was the highlight
of this trip for me.

376
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:18,815
The pleasure is mine.

377
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,441
Um…

378
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,776
Quickly now.

379
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,654
You remember my name now, right?

380
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,406
Huh? Of course.

381
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,782
Good.

382
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,286
Don't forget next time.

383
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,289
Well, see you.

384
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,416
<i>Next time?</i>

385
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,210
Let's go, Laios!

386
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,504
There's no turning back now.

387
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,215
Crap. See?

388
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,385
I just knew this was going
to happen in the end.

389
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:48,344
Crap!

390
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,430
That's vulgar, Chil.

391
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,098
I'm sorry.

392
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,145
It'll all work out somehow.
