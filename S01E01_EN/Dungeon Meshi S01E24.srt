00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,816
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,058
Izutsumi, Chilchuck...

3
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,936
Could you slow down a bit?

4
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,647
{\an8}Cracks are all over the floor,
and it's hard to walk.

5
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:47,399
I didn't notice.

6
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,819
Let's take a break.

7
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,072
{\an8}What is this? An old folks' stroll?

8
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,784
Something's bothering me.

9
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,827
In our current forms,

10
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,288
{\an8}how different are our actual ages
from how old we look?

11
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,999
Laios, how old are you now?

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,751
I'm 26.

13
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,338
Senshi, how old
does Laios look to you now?

14
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,341
Around 60, maybe?

15
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:16,137
<i>They say a dwarf lives
2.5 times longer than a tall-man.</i>

16
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,305
<i>So 26 years for a tall-man...</i>

17
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,933
<i>is like 65 for a dwarf.</i>

18
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,104
<i>So, our appearance
reflects our actual age.</i>

19
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,065
What really concerns me
is our remaining lifespan.

20
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,360
Do we age at the same pace
as before our transformation,

21
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,863
or do we age according to our new forms?

22
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:38,325
Marcille, you act like
this is none of your concern.

23
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,785
But if the latter is true,

24
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:43,122
the average lifespan
for us half-foots is 50!

25
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:47,209
{\an8}In less than 40 years,
you'll be all wrinkled and die!

26
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,419
{\an8}What?!

27
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,255
WRINKLECILLE

28
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,632
Is the lifespan really that short?

29
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,718
I thought you could live until 100.

30
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,386
Some do, but...

31
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,762
It's only a small percentage.

32
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,270
I was just joking.

33
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:11,066
My point is, if that's true,
these mushrooms are too convenient.

34
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:15,070
There are loads of people who would pay
a fortune to change their race,

35
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,781
but I've never seen those mushrooms
for sale anywhere.

36
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,367
<i>In other words, this transformation
must be temporary,</i>

37
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,119
<i>or it comes with nasty side effects.</i>

38
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,163
Side effects, huh?

39
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,040
That's a possibility.

40
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,542
I was hoping
we could make use of it somehow,

41
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,461
but I guess it's not that simple.

42
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,962
Make use of it how?

43
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,964
Do you want to become
a demi-human or something?

44
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:35,549
T-That's not it.

45
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,802
I was thinking about Falin.

46
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,137
Falin?

47
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,348
This is just a what-if, but...

48
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,559
Say everything works out, and we manage
to defeat the lunatic magician.

49
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,937
I repent.

50
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,313
<i>Falin regains herself.</i>

51
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,399
What have I been doing?

52
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,567
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

53
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,236
<i>We return to the surface.</i>

54
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,196
Honestly, we had such a rough time!

55
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,074
<i>People will be terrified.</i>

56
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:01,575
{\an8}Right?

57
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,079
I think it'll be tough for her
to remain a dragon from the waist down.

58
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,330
- You stupid--
- Hold on!

59
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,790
Let's hear him out.

60
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,293
<i>I've thought of hiding the lower part
of her body inside a hole.</i>

61
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:12,336
Welcome!

62
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,462
<i>However,</i>

63
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:17,967
{\an8}a large monster can't survive
in a village with little mana.

64
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,428
Just like a fish can't survive
outside of water,

65
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:24,348
Falin might not be able
to survive in a village.

66
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,475
And that's where

67
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,645
those Changeling mushrooms come into play.

68
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:34,733
<i>If we can somehow change
her lower body to a smaller dragon,</i>

69
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,070
Falin might be able to live comfortably
in a human village!

70
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,282
- What--
- What an optimistic guy!

71
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,491
Mušḫuššu!

72
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:46,495
{\an8}Well, I won't deny
that I also have a wish to transform.

73
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,291
Tall-men are just
so unremarkable and dull...

74
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:53,002
Hey, don't you hear that strange noise?

75
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,130
No. It's probably
the sound of dwarf relics.

76
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,339
It's not that.

77
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,883
It sounds like rocks
striking against each other.

78
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,512
And it seems like
it's slowly getting closer.

79
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,307
I know.

80
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,851
{\an8}Gargoyles!

81
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,021
Didn't you close the door properly?

82
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,897
W-We need to get out of here quickly!

83
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,150
They're getting closer!

84
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,611
If we don't do something,
they'll keep coming after us.

85
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,448
We should ambush them.

86
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,408
{\an8}B-But...

87
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,993
{\an8}I'll distract the enemies.

88
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,328
{\an8}Chilchuck, hold the pot.

89
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,163
{\an8}Izutsumi, slip around behind them.

90
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,831
{\an8}Senshi, wait for the right moment.

91
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,458
{\an8}Marcille, how close are the enemies?

92
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,542
{\an8}Like I said,

93
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,294
they're right there!

94
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,298
Laios!

95
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,634
Damn it!

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,762
Everyone, watch out!

97
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,063
Do you get why the first thing I do
is take cover?

98
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,856
Don't hang around our feet.

99
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,441
Easier said than done...

100
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,777
Forget it! You're still as clumsy as ever.

101
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,778
Come here!

102
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,742
What is this smoke?

103
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,994
Is it one of your magic?

104
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,580
Are you two hurt?

105
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,124
No! The sword
just passed between our arms!

106
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,084
Good.

107
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,668
Pass me Kensuke, would you?

108
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:17,586
Sure.

109
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,716
Did it always look like that?

110
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,759
Nope.

111
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,385
Has the shape of the sword changed?

112
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,013
Was that smoke...

113
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,141
- Spores from Changelings?
- Spores from Changelings?

114
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,770
{\an8}B-But I don't see
a ring of mushrooms anywhere.

115
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,272
It passed through a circle
we formed with our arms.

116
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,109
Does that mean...

117
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,534
They keep flying away!

118
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,535
Everyone!

119
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,287
Hold hands and make a ring right now!

120
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,123
Read the situation before you say that!

121
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,249
I did!

122
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,044
Now what?

123
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,171
What do we do?

124
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,049
We'll get a Gargoyle
to pass through our ring.

125
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,926
If my guess is correct,

126
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,595
{\an8}the Gargoyle will transform!

127
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,515
Here it comes! Dodge!

128
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,725
There's a wall on that side! This way!

129
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:14,768
Ow!

130
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:17,521
I'll tear in two!

131
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,526
Owie.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,788
It's stuck!

133
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,290
Now, surround it quickly!

134
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,926
{\an8}We did it! Where's the Gargoyle?

135
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,303
{\an8}Look!

136
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,682
That's the Gargoyle?

137
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,851
It really transformed!

138
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,353
I see. The Changelings caused this.

139
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,315
So nonliving things change faster.

140
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,233
Laios!

141
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,359
Are you okay?

142
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,361
It hurts, but I'll manage.

143
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,072
Dwarves have sturdy bodies.

144
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,115
{\an8}Damn it.

145
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,912
That one won't come down.

146
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,623
How can we get it
to pass through our arms?

147
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,295
- Marcille.
- Huh?

148
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,796
- Give me your hand for a bit.
- Huh?

149
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,968
- It should work.
- Um.

150
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,428
- Let's do it.
- All right!

151
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,097
We're going to get up close to it,

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,266
and provoke it into attacking us!

153
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,560
- Hey, what do I--
- Run in sync with the call!

154
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:39,937
Here we go!

155
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,191
- One, two...
- One, two...

156
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:50,072
- One, two...
- One, two...

157
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,243
Here it comes! Are you ready?

158
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,827
Ready for what?!

159
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,663
- Ready, set...
- Ready, set...

160
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,581
Fly, Marcille!

161
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,806
It's over.

162
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,934
There was nothing to it.

163
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:23,355
All we had to do was wash the spores
off our bodies to turn back.

164
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,732
It feels wrong.

165
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,776
Don't worry about it. It's just water.

166
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,861
You should wash them off thoroughly.

167
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,614
Right now, we're like
seedbeds for mushrooms.

168
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,661
<i>Now I understand why those mushrooms
have this characteristic.</i>

169
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,082
<i>When animals have their forms
changed by Changelings...</i>

170
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,417
- Run!
- Run!

171
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,002
<i>They're hated by their own kind.</i>

172
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,670
<i>They die.</i>

173
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,256
<i>And they become new Changelings.</i>

174
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,174
It's quite the side effect.

175
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,596
Unlike Gargoyles,
it'll take time for us to turn back.

176
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,973
Let's prepare a meal as we wait.

177
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,434
Of course.

178
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,190
<i>Kensuke, look at how you've changed.</i>

179
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:12,613
<i>I doubt it was the mushrooms
that turned the insides into a key, but...</i>

180
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,407
<i>Will it revert if I give it a wash?</i>

181
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,661
What are we having today?

182
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:23,081
We still have some dumplings left,
so we'll boil them.

183
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,416
That again.

184
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,460
Do you have a problem?

185
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,545
Not really. I'm just tired of them.

186
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,299
- <i>Tired of them?</i>
- She sure is a free spirit.

187
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,636
<i>I'll try cooking them differently.</i>

188
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:41,350
<i>Heat oil in a pan,
and gently place the dumplings in it.</i>

189
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,310
H-Hot!

190
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,898
<i>When the wrappers are golden brown,
take them out and let the oil drain.</i>

191
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,984
{\an8}<i>Izutsumi is a light eater</i>

192
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,403
{\an8}<i>and never touches something
she doesn't like.</i>

193
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:57,741
<i>To make sure she eats enough,
I have to put in the time and effort.</i>

194
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,413
What do you think, Izutsumi?

195
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,415
You just fried them?

196
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,125
Stop that!

197
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,173
<i>Just maybe...</i>

198
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,306
It changed its shape!

199
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,976
Just as I thought,
it seems like the mouth acts as a ring.

200
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,979
And there are so many
varieties of dumplings.

201
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,691
What if I eat one and end up
growing mushrooms in my stomach?

202
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:36,071
We had the Hippogriff's meat,
and that didn't happen.

203
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,697
Digestion is quite powerful.

204
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,784
Now, help set the dishes.

205
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,786
It's done!

206
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,455
DUMPLINGS TRANSFORMED
BY A CHANGELING FAIRY RING

207
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,332
There are so many types.

208
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,923
This one has Barometz meat in it.

209
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,633
Mutton, huh?

210
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,718
So the filling changes too.

211
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,430
This one's got cheese inside!

212
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,223
This one's sweet.

213
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,143
<i>What meat is this?</i>

214
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,819
Your legs are just too long!

215
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,574
{\an8}My body's back to normal!

216
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,616
{\an8}Damn it.

217
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,368
{\an8}What an awful way to wake up.

218
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,162
Thank goodness.

219
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,997
I'm so glad.

220
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,041
Well then, we should get going soon.

221
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,253
You should change into something lighter.

222
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,338
This floor is warm.

223
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,634
The temperature is conducive
to creature reproduction.

224
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:44,347
But I'm not sure if there are any living
things ahead in this environment.

225
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,268
I should have made sausages or something.

226
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,855
Speaking of which,
didn't you make some with Red Dragon meat?

227
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:53,899
<i>I did.</i>

228
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,066
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

229
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,194
But I lost them.

230
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,570
Is that so?

231
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,821
Never mind.

232
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,449
I don't like it when it's hot.

233
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,703
Why is your sword wrapped in a cloth?

234
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,872
{\an8}Huh? That's because...

235
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,165
{\an8}Show me.

236
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,125
{\an8}No, I can't do that.

237
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,335
{\an8}Show me!

238
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,963
What should we do with him?

239
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,008
Should we form a ring around him
and beat him up?

240
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,802
Go wash it off right now.

241
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,723
How are things over there?

242
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,100
All I see is a strange building.

243
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,894
I don't see any other paths.

244
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,607
A strange building?

245
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,155
It's probably an automatic trolley.

246
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,032
Let's take a peek inside.

247
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,913
I bet it won't move anymore.

248
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,542
If you dismantle it and sell it,
you can fetch a pretty good price.

249
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,421
It moved!

250
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,674
Senshi, what did you do?

251
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,967
Nothing.

252
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,220
Maybe it's the type that moves
when someone boards it.

253
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,056
There's a description here,
so I'll read it.

254
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:09,933
Take a seat.

255
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,493
There isn't much written here.

256
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,830
It doesn't feel dangerous so far,

257
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,207
so let's ride it as far as it goes.

258
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,588
Maybe I'll brew some tea.

259
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,465
What's that?

260
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,343
Roasted Dryad seeds.

261
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,178
Is the magic circle ready?

262
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,263
I think so.

263
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,600
I can't say for sure if it's working.

264
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,938
{\an8}It's slow, but it seems to be heating up.

265
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,982
By the way, Laios,

266
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,777
why did you and your sister
become adventurers?

267
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,571
{\an8}Huh? Me?

268
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,824
{\an8}You don't strike me as someone
who dreams of making a fortune.

269
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,453
{\an8}It's a long story, but...

270
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:16,499
{\an8}<i>When I was in my teens,
I got fed up with my village.</i>

271
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,252
<i>And I went to a school in the town
and joined the army.</i>

272
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,256
{\an8}<i>But in the end,
I didn't fit in there either.</i>

273
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,426
<i>And I got picked up by a caravan
that passed through the town.</i>

274
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,136
<i>So he's a deserter?</i>

275
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,307
<i>I slowly drifted south,
taking odd jobs along the way.</i>

276
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,354
<i>Falin was boarding
at a nearby magic school,</i>

277
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,522
<i>so I dropped by to see her.</i>

278
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,858
<i>But she insisted on joining me.</i>

279
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,989
<i>And together, we reached this island.</i>

280
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,869
<i>When we first arrived on this island,
gold-peeling was thriving.</i>

281
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,788
<i>And there was plenty of escorting work.</i>

282
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,501
<i>Then, we just stayed
and hung around the dungeon.</i>

283
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,055
That's how I ended up here.

284
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:16,434
What a complete lack of foresight.

285
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:20,063
You're one thing, but why did you
let your sister go with you?

286
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,857
She could've had a better life at school.

287
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,405
<i>Falin's childhood wasn't very fortunate.</i>

288
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,199
<i>She had a talent for magic,
which she was shunned for.</i>

289
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,328
<i>I couldn't stand the environment.</i>

290
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,747
<i>So I left the village
a year before she did.</i>

291
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,001
<i>Until she entered the magic school, no,</i>

292
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,336
<i>until she met Marcille,</i>

293
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,463
<i>she had her meals all alone.</i>

294
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,676
It breaks my heart to think about it.

295
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:55,181
Well, Falin's spirit
was much stronger than mine,

296
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,976
so maybe it didn't bother her too much.

297
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,856
But that's why I made a promise to myself
to never abandon her again.

298
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,818
At least, not until someone else shows up
whom she wants to be with.

299
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,995
What the heck? Gross!

300
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,164
Falin...

301
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,584
used to bring me a lot of things.

302
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,087
<i>Strange nuts.</i>

303
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,048
<i>And odd plants.</i>

304
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,676
<i>I've always wondered
why she kept bringing them to me, but...</i>

305
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,013
She probably wanted
to eat them with you, Marcille.

306
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,909
{\an8}I can't wait...

307
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,703
{\an8}to share meals with her again.

308
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,623
You'll be able to soon.

309
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,918
The way I see it,

310
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,754
Falin is like bacon and eggs right now.

311
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,925
We once compared souls to eggs.

312
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,719
<i>A sunny side up rests on top
of strips of bacon.</i>

313
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:18,932
<i>They're stuck together, but it looks like
we can peel them apart nicely.</i>

314
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,725
<i>That's Falin.</i>

315
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,353
Compared to that,
Izutsumi is more like an omelet

316
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,938
with ingredients mixed inside.

317
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:29,192
<i>With effort, you might be able
to remove the ingredients,</i>

318
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,904
<i>but it's easy to imagine
the egg getting broken up.</i>

319
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,615
So, in Izutsumi's case,

320
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:40,203
we'll have to find a more careful
and complicated approach.

321
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,455
In other words,

322
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,458
<i>if we cut off the dragon waist down,</i>

323
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,961
<i>can we turn Falin back
into her human form?</i>

324
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,964
It's not that simple, is it?

325
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,590
That day,

326
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,927
I preserved some of the Dragon meat,

327
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,182
but it all turned back into flesh
and merged with Falin.

328
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,687
<i>On the other hand, some of the meat
didn't turn back into a dragon.</i>

329
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,357
It's the parts that we ate at dinner.

330
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:14,821
Meat that has been digested
by other creatures loses its identity.

331
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,491
{\an8}This is the only clear law in this dungeon

332
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,661
{\an8}where the line
between life and death is blurred.

333
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:26,457
In that case,
if we consume all the dragon parts,

334
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:31,004
we may be able to drive out
the soul of the dragon.

335
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,050
Y-You know,

336
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,761
I'm surprised
to hear that from you, Senshi.

337
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,973
I thought you were against
that sort of thing.

338
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,268
I'm still against resurrecting people.

339
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,897
However, Falin is alive now.

340
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,776
And you just want to release her
from the dungeon.

341
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,030
I'll gladly help you with that.

342
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,783
Eat the dragon parts.

343
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,120
B-But...

344
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,832
how many meals would that make?

345
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,542
- That's your problem?
- That's your problem?

346
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,960
What else would it be?

347
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,588
It's the most promising method
we've got so far!

348
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,590
Do you have a better idea?

349
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,260
{\an8}Consuming a creature you've killed
to make it your own.

350
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,596
{\an8}Why didn't I realize it sooner?

351
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,349
{\an8}It's what we've been doing all along!

352
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,769
But it's massive.

353
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,231
<i>Even if the five of us push
to consume a kilogram each day,</i>

354
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,358
<i>it'll still take us
over a decade to finish it all.</i>

355
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,778
Do you honestly think
I can handle eating a kilogram?

356
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,615
And considering Falin's condition,
we definitely don't have time for that.

357
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,369
So, just ask others to help.

358
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:48,206
It's time to make full use
of the connections you've built.

359
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,875
You're banking on my connections for this?

360
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,253
It's not like you're without any.

361
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,213
Can't you think of anyone?

362
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,383
<i>The orcs.</i>

363
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,135
<i>They'll likely eat a fair amount
and seem like a promising choice.</i>

364
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,304
<i>The inhabitants of the Golden Castle.</i>

365
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,015
<i>They might not have
the heartiest appetite,</i>

366
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,643
<i>but their numbers and livestock
can compensate for that.</i>

367
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,354
<i>Then there's Namari, Shuro,
and their groups.</i>

368
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,898
<i>Those two will lend a hand
if we appeal to their emotions.</i>

369
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:17,277
<i>And Kabru seemed interested
in trying monster food.</i>

370
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,905
That's all I can come up with
at the moment.

371
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,032
That's quite a list.

372
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,159
But we're hardly enough
to consume the entire dragon.

373
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,954
I wish we could also have another troop.

374
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,330
But at least

375
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,333
we've got clear goals now.

376
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:38,172
<i>First, we release the Winged Lion
from the heart of the dungeon.</i>

377
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,173
<i>Second,</i>

378
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:43,177
<i>with the Lion's aid, we neutralize
the lunatic magician's power.</i>

379
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,178
<i>Third,</i>

380
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:48,516
<i>we recruit people to assist us
in consuming Falin's dragon parts.</i>

381
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,352
I'm suddenly
feeling optimistic about this.

382
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,314
It's going to be one extravagant feast.

383
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,066
There are no troops inside the dungeon.

384
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,737
What's this sickening feeling?

385
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,948
The air in the dungeon is stale.

386
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,618
While you guys were inside,
it underwent another big transformation.

387
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,037
A transformation?

388
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,663
You'll get it once you see it.

389
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:14,459
Well, it's going to be
an unpleasant transformation

390
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,627
for the folks behind us, at least.

391
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:28,723
Don't eat stuff like that!

392
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,852
What's all this racket?

393
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,230
{\an8}<i>Walking Mushrooms.</i>

394
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,442
{\an8}How about using them
as a garnish for a steak

395
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,360
{\an8}made from Falin's dragon parts?

396
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,988
{\an8}Or should we make a stew instead?

397
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,115
{\an8}- The broth from the bones--
- Stop it!

398
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,077
{\an8}Now's not the time
to be planning Falin menus!

399
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm hungry.

400
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,998
Shall we prepare something?

401
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,374
I second that!

402
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,376
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

403
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,837
<i>Eat or be eaten.</i>

404
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,256
<i>There is no hierarchy.</i>

405
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,135
<i>Eating is a privilege for those who live.</i>

406
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,805
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

407
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,474
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>
