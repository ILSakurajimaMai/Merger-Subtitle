MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,928
<i>On the third basement floor
of the dungeon,</i>

3
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:37,056
<i>through the underground graveyard
and past the forest of the spire,</i>

4
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,850
<i>you reach the Golden Castle.</i>

5
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,312
<i>The once splendid castle</i>

6
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,524
<i>is now covered in mold and dust
and is a shadow of what it used to be.</i>

7
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:49,860
<i>The footsteps that come
as if from nowhere,</i>

8
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,987
<i>could they belong to an adventurer?</i>

9
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,406
<i>Or could they belong to a former resident
who has passed away</i>

10
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,158
<i>but is still wandering around?</i>

11
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,245
That's a skeleton.

12
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,374
And they're humans.

13
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,878
That's a ghoul.

14
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,131
How can you tell? You're creeping me out!

15
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,633
The footsteps of a living creature,
bones, and something rotten

16
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,884
are totally different.

17
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,182
Let's go left.

18
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,434
The Golem seems to be wary
of what's on the right.

19
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:28,691
<i>A Golem is a human-shaped magical creature
made of mud, dirt, and stone.</i>

20
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,819
<i>It is used as a puppet
that faithfully follows</i>

21
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,279
<i>its master's commands.</i>

22
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,363
Stop.

23
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,701
For your information, Golems are 99% dirt!

24
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,077
They aren't edible!

25
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,162
They are genuinely magical creatures!

26
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,039
I even know how to make them!

27
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,916
- Teach me!
- No!

28
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,794
{\an8}What do you want to use them for
after you learn how to make them?

29
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,548
What I'm interested in is their bodies.

30
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,883
Follow me.

31
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,556
This is the campsite
I usually use as my base.

32
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,476
You live here?

33
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,770
I hardly sleep here.

34
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,357
I usually hunt
on the second or fourth floor,

35
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,945
and once a month, I shop for seasoning
and other things I lack in town.

36
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,741
<i>It was on my way back
from a shopping trip that I met you folks.</i>

37
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,494
There are only a few monsters
you can eat on the third floor.

38
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,707
They are mostly decayed or just bones.

39
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,958
But...

40
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,710
<i>Golems!</i>

41
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,671
<i>These wonderful creatures are different!</i>

42
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,716
<i>Their bodies are high in nutrition,</i>

43
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,303
and always maintain
the appropriate temperature and humidity.

44
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,431
In other words,

45
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,100
are you using Golems as a garden?

46
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,769
The people in this castle will weep!

47
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,687
And so will scholars of magic!

48
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,189
Why?

49
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:54,276
I don't like magic,
but those creatures deserve praise.

50
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,946
All gardens should be like that!

51
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,949
<i>After all, they're resistant
to harmful insects.</i>

52
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,993
<i>And they drive away vegetable thieves.</i>

53
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,954
<i>I don't think
they're after the vegetables.</i>

54
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,457
<i>What's more,
they even control moisture levels.</i>

55
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,542
<i>If you plant seeds and seedlings in them,</i>

56
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,212
<i>they'll take care
of the rest of the cultivation.</i>

57
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:17,007
That said,
you still have to tend them carefully.

58
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,718
That's why I have my base here.

59
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:36,819
Here they come!

60
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,821
What now?

61
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,155
- Need our help?
- No need!

62
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,426
Wow.

63
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,802
He's used to this.

64
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,723
How does he know
where the Golem's core is located?

65
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,641
Don't tell me...

66
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,226
It's done.

67
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,855
Harvest the vegetables from the Golems.

68
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:17,276
I thought they were covered in green,
but are these all vegetables?

69
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:20,487
From a Golem's perspective,
aren't they like parasites?

70
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:25,951
On the contrary,
the plants' roots make the soil firmer,

71
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,162
so you could say
they're in a symbiotic relationship.

72
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,705
Are you sure?

73
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,124
But please remove the weeds.

74
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,175
What a rich harvest!

75
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,636
Looks like we can finally enjoy
some normal vegetables!

76
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,930
Bring the weeds over here.

77
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,850
Stack them up in this spot
and they will wither.

78
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,934
Once they're withered,

79
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,771
I'll return them to the Golems' bodies,
and they'll naturally decompose.

80
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:59,068
And this is fertilizer I made elsewhere.

81
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,695
I mix this into the Golems!

82
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,821
I knew it!

83
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,198
You knew what?

84
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:08,577
{\an8}You knew where the Golems' cores were
because you're the one who planted them!

85
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,454
Unbelievable.

86
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,332
It's illegal to activate
a magical creature without permission!

87
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:18,337
{\an8}All I'm doing is digging up dirt
and putting it back.

88
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,922
{\an8}So, you're bypassing the law!

89
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,342
<i>Stir the soil well and make raised rows.</i>

90
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,929
<i>Planting the same crop repeatedly
leads to monocropping issues,</i>

91
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,348
<i>so sow the seeds in a different Golem.</i>

92
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,352
I'm exhausted.

93
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:37,064
I feel like I used more stamina
than when fighting monsters.

94
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,692
Thanks to your help,
it got done much quicker.

95
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,529
Drinking water
made me want to use the bathroom.

96
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,867
Well then, while that elven girl is gone,

97
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,121
I'll gather up the scattered soil
as much as I can.

98
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,005
Taro, Jiro, Saburo.

99
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,008
Will burying those
make them revive quickly?

100
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,011
No, it takes some time.

101
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,931
<i>They'll revive
just when the seeds begin to take root,</i>

102
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,433
<i>and the soil stays in place
even when they move around.</i>

103
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,773
He treats the Golems with so much care.

104
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,942
I'm impressed.

105
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,902
So this is how you were living.

106
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,779
Wasn't it tough?

107
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,074
I do it because I like it.

108
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,826
It's not tough at all.

109
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,914
That's about it.

110
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:39,334
Now, let's enjoy the fruits of our labor!

111
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,548
What a beautiful color.

112
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,551
I've sure gotten better at peeling.

113
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,347
Is this size really okay?

114
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,682
It's perfect.

115
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:58,103
Are you making fire? I can do it for you.

116
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,063
I'll strike a flint, so it's fine.

117
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,943
You always make a fire like that,
but using magic is faster.

118
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,071
You were just singing the praises
of how convenient Golems are.

119
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:12,326
When you make something easier,
you may lose your edge in a skill.

120
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,620
Convenience and ease
aren't the same thing.

121
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,082
Your method is no different
from buying vegetables from the store.

122
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,675
This is the last of the Basilisk bacon.

123
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,431
It's done.

124
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,100
FRESH VEGETABLE LUNCH
FROM THE GOLEM GARDEN

125
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,102
- Let's dig in!
- Let's dig in!

126
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,486
It's so good!

127
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,364
It's odd to think such tasty vegetables
can grow underground!

128
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,367
I wonder if something inside the Golems
is affecting the flavor.

129
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,451
Stop it!

130
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,287
I don't care if they walk or yell.
They're gardens!

131
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,625
Speaking of which,
Golems are 99% soil, right?

132
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,627
What's the last 1%?

133
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,629
It's a secret.

134
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,925
Phew, that was delicious.

135
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,760
I'm so full.

136
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,137
I'm feeling sleepy after eating so much.

137
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,598
You can rest.

138
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,226
There's a little something
I want to take care of.

139
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,312
Clean up!

140
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,647
I'm going to the toilet.

141
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,776
The toilets around here are so proper.

142
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,904
They aren't some random holes
dug in the ground.

143
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,366
<i>In busy areas of the dungeon,</i>

144
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,910
<i>there are designated spots
for people to relieve themselves.</i>

145
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,621
{\an8}They're always kept clean,

146
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,165
{\an8}and sometimes
they're even decorated with flowers.

147
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,418
There must be some diligent people here.

148
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,170
Hm?

149
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,922
Senshi!

150
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,133
What is it?

151
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,301
What are you doing?

152
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:57,014
I'm collecting the feces and urine
and carrying them to the chamber pots.

153
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,433
I'm impressed you can do that
right after a meal.

154
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,477
They serve as crucial fertilizers
down here.

155
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,563
You mean they were also used
for the vegetables...

156
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,900
{\an8}Marcille, they do the same thing
on the surface, too.

157
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,153
{\an8}I know that, but it's still gross.

158
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,074
Why are you so determined
to stick to your life in the dungeon?

159
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,578
If you want a self-sufficient life,
you could have it above ground as well.

160
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:24,541
Don't you think it'd be easier
to cultivate a garden outside and hunt?

161
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,254
Then who else will maintain
the toilets in the dungeon?

162
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,884
Who will remove the zombies
that fall inside the toilets?

163
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,803
Who will help up the fallen Golems?

164
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,850
There used to be over ten Golems,
but now there are only three.

165
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,436
<i>Without Golems,</i>

166
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,230
<i>monsters from the lower levels
will climb up here.</i>

167
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,651
<i>And the monsters driven out
by those monsters will enter other places.</i>

168
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,945
<i>And they will drive out other monsters.</i>

169
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,617
<i>If that happens,
this dungeon will be a different place.</i>

170
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,994
<i>You wouldn't be able
to stroll or hunt in here.</i>

171
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,456
The dungeon is just like a garden.

172
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,377
You can't abandon them
and expect to reap their rewards.

173
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:09,711
More than anything,

174
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:14,800
<i>eating the things that grow here
and giving back to the dungeon...</i>

175
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,972
<i>Living like this, I finally feel like
I've truly entered this dungeon.</i>

176
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,433
And that makes me happy.

177
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,979
But if that's the case,

178
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,191
is it okay for you
to leave this place on our behalf?

179
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,610
If this place falls into chaos...

180
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,320
Don't worry about it.

181
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,283
Even if I'm away for a month or two,
the Golems will take care of things.

182
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:45,038
Besides, I wouldn't rest easy at night
if you all died from malnutrition.

183
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,039
Give me a minute.

184
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,749
I'll get ready in a hurry.

185
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,882
Senshi is so amazing.

186
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,471
What are you going to do
with these vegetables?

187
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,016
I usually use them for bartering.

188
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,019
Sometimes I set up
an unmanned booth and sell them.

189
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,855
<i>An unmanned booth?</i>

190
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,275
<i>I used to collect the money
in a treasure box,</i>

191
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,611
but I stopped
because they kept getting stolen.

192
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,405
<i>So that's why that treasure box...</i>

193
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,115
<i>...Always had money in it.</i>

194
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:24,035
So, do you do your bartering around here?

195
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,914
I have customers on a lower floor,

196
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,333
but even if we go now,
they probably won't have time for us.

197
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,128
I didn't want to leave
the garden lying idle,

198
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,296
so I harvested the crops.

199
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,339
But you can throw them away
if you don't need them.

200
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,176
You can't do that!
You shouldn't waste food!

201
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,930
You worked so hard to cultivate them,
and they're so glossy and delicious!

202
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,265
You're growing attached to them.

203
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,937
Well, in that case,
we really should trade them around here.

204
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,065
- <i>Around here, huh?</i>
- <i>Around here, huh?</i>

205
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,944
<i>There are merchants
even inside the dungeon.</i>

206
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,325
Enter.

207
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,123
<i>Many of their customers are adventurers</i>

208
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,543
<i>or people who, for reasons,
can't go back above ground.</i>

209
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,299
Welcome, my dear guests.

210
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,885
Are you looking for a place to stay
or something to eat?

211
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,261
We want to trade.

212
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,846
Well, well.

213
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,933
So, what do you have?

214
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,309
Vegetables.

215
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,104
Go away, go away!

216
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,564
Wait, at least listen to...

217
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,942
{\an8}If you want to trade, bring coins!

218
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,694
{\an8}Do you understand? Coins!

219
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,571
{\an8}The round, shiny, and glittery things!

220
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,574
It's not like we want
to trade them for gems.

221
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,326
You have a kitchen here, don't you?

222
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,327
You need ingredients...

223
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,329
These are round and shiny, too.

224
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,332
Show this carrot to your cook.

225
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,708
I'm sure they'll want to use it.

226
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,419
Who would eat something so disgusting?!

227
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,797
How awful!

228
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,551
{\an8}You'll incur divine punishment
if you waste food!

229
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,179
Throw them out now!

230
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,181
{\an8}- Quickly now!
- Listen to--

231
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,059
Huh?

232
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,315
Orcs!

233
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,277
Kill the ones with weapons first!

234
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,320
Don't leave even one alive!

235
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,327
Why are orcs here?

236
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,705
I thought they were on much lower floors.

237
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,665
Anyway, we have to run...

238
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,713
- Marcille!
- Wait.

239
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,264
What are you doing here, Senshi?

240
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,018
That's what I want to ask as well.

241
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,064
Are these folks your acquaintances?

242
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,065
That's right.

243
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,861
To think you would associate
with humans and an elf.

244
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,155
By customers, did you mean...

245
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,906
I meant them.

246
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:12,454
I figured he meant folks like them,
but orcs, huh?

247
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,039
I thought they'd be goblins at least.

248
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,333
I assumed he meant Kobolds.

249
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,585
{\an8}The Red Dragon showed up.

250
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:24,257
<i>The Red Dragon
that rarely appeared in the past.</i>

251
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:29,220
{\an8}But lately, it's been showing up
near our settlement.

252
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,848
{\an8}There are some who can't fight
in our settlement.

253
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,227
{\an8}We came to this floor
for temporary refuge.

254
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,647
The Red Dragon, could it be?

255
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,774
The Dragon, where did you see it?

256
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:45,236
Are you asking me
to tell you where our settlement is?

257
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,154
I refuse.

258
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,907
Boss, we dealt with everyone inside.

259
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:49,949
Good.

260
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,160
Carry out everything that might be useful.

261
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,037
What on earth?

262
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,665
Rotten milk?

263
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,208
Throw it away.

264
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,169
Those are crops you cultivated, right?

265
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,547
As you can see, we're in need right now.

266
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,549
I'd like you to share that with me.

267
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,635
For barter?

268
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,011
In that case, these are...

269
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:10,929
No.

270
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,472
As I said,

271
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,517
we can't afford that right now.

272
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,979
It pains me to ask this of a friend,

273
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,441
but I want you to give us
all the stuff you have there.

274
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,611
S-Senshi.

275
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,697
Very well.

276
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,240
Good.

277
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,451
But in exchange,
I have a favor to ask you.

278
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,788
Tonight, let us stay at your place.

279
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,706
- Huh?
- Huh?

280
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,666
If you will grant us that,

281
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,752
we will gladly offer our lives
or our vegetables.

282
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,670
Huh?

283
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,130
And you there!

284
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,465
That isn't rotten, it's fermented!

285
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,300
Be sure to take it with you!

286
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,306
Why did you say that?

287
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,058
They took our weapons.

288
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,519
If we learn the location
of their campsite,

289
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,354
we'll never see the light of day again.

290
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,399
You do have a plan, right?

291
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,988
The jar I told an orc to take earlier

292
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,574
is leaven made of yeast.

293
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:17,829
And the orcs have the flour
that was in the kitchen.

294
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,997
In other words...

295
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:19,998
In other words?

296
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,834
I can make bread!

297
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,545
- Moron!
- So you don't have a plan!

298
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,089
- Moron!
- You just wanted to make bread!

299
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,299
Moron!

300
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,134
Hey, there! Be quiet!

301
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,680
It's an elf!

302
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,640
What a barbaric face.

303
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,809
Stay inside this cage.

304
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,145
Dad came back!

305
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,399
We better not end up
becoming their meal for today.

306
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,110
Where did you put the leaven?!

307
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,573
If you don't know how to use it,
you're sitting on a gold mine!

308
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,034
Give it to me! I'll make you bread!

309
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,912
Bread!

310
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:05,251
Mix together strong-wheat flour,
salt, sugar, leaven, and water.

311
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,671
And knead it until it comes together.

312
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,174
Are you playing with mud?

313
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,175
Huh?

314
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,553
How about a history lesson?

315
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,849
This is a story about a time
when we were still living above ground

316
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,559
instead of under the ground.

317
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,729
People like that elf and humans there

318
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,733
killed many of our people
and took our lands.

319
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,529
Orcs killed a lot of other races, too.

320
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,446
What?

321
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,448
Now, you add olive oil.

322
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,578
We were forced to leave the surface
and after wandering for a while,

323
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:44,958
we found our place underground,
and we had peace for a while.

324
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,794
Until they found us again.

325
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,965
Hold the edge of the dough
and knead it by punching it down.

326
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,927
They poured oil into the underground
and set fire to it.

327
00:18:55,927 --> 00:19:00,640
That's because you orcs kept raiding
the villages of other races over and over!

328
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,810
It was the only way for us to survive.

329
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,188
That was your way of life
even before you moved underground.

330
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,731
That's why you were driven out!

331
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,484
Stop it, Marcille. That's enough--

332
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,278
Shut up, half-foot!

333
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,697
Knead it with more strength, will you?!

334
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,739
Sorry.

335
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,992
Give it to me! I'll do it!

336
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,452
We were driven from the surface
and fled underground.

337
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,580
And when we finally
arrived at the dungeon,

338
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,874
you folks tried to take it from us!

339
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,419
It was the villagers
above ground who found it first!

340
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,255
{\an8}But we went into the depths first!

341
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,049
{\an8}Then the zombies roaming around
were there before anyone else!

342
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,386
Once the dough stretches smoothly,
it's time for the first fermentation.

343
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,811
When the dough doubles in size,
divide it evenly and shape it neatly.

344
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,480
You've been silent
this whole time, tall-man.

345
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,066
But what are you thinking?

346
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,404
<i>They say anyone who defeats
the lunatic magician who built this place</i>

347
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,449
<i>will gain this whole castle.</i>

348
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,660
Why are you trying
to go to the depths of the dungeon?

349
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,540
{\an8}When you gain the kingdom,
what will you do?

350
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:13,922
I've heard of that story,
but I've never thought of that.

351
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,882
What a joke.

352
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,551
All adventures are like you.

353
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,679
You make your daily wage
and you test your skills.

354
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,932
You're all just greedy fools.

355
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:27,352
I shudder to think what might happen
if someone like you

356
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,062
ends up getting this castle.

357
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,733
{\an8}That's why we kill anyone
from the surface we can find.

358
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,360
What a poor excuse!

359
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,029
Then you should compete
for the throne as well.

360
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,782
Or is plundering
the only thing orcs can do?

361
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,284
At least you have spunk.

362
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:44,786
I like that.

363
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,455
{\an8}I'll throw you into the fire alive!

364
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,874
{\an8}See? You turn to violence so quickly!

365
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,626
Second fermentation.

366
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,382
Once it has expanded enough,

367
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,385
cook it on low heat one side at a time.

368
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,637
Let it steam a little,

369
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,889
and open the lid.

370
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,476
And the bread is done!

371
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,937
It smells so good!

372
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,605
Let's have a taste.

373
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,984
Stop! That bread is ours.

374
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,902
We won't give it to you.

375
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:18,903
What?

376
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,739
I let you make bread
because you wanted to,

377
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,701
but what we do with it is up to us.

378
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:27,829
Dad.

379
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:32,583
These people made it together,
but they don't get to eat it?

380
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,132
That's because bread alone
won't make a meal.

381
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:45,096
You need a main dish, meat, and vegetables
for a well-balanced meal.

382
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:49,183
Your father just wanted us to wait
until the other dishes were ready.

383
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,601
Hey! What are you saying?!

384
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,896
Exactly. He promised
to provide lodging for a night

385
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,773
in exchange for our vegetables.

386
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,569
And your father is someone
who can't break promises.

387
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,201
Hey! Make them some random food!

388
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,209
FRESHLY PICKED STEWED CABBAGE

389
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,128
Here! It's ready!

390
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,339
- Eat!
- Okay.

391
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,423
Thank you.

392
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,682
I-It's good!

393
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,225
So spicy!

394
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,811
It's spicy and delicious!

395
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,731
It's made with the same ingredients
as Senshi's stewed cabbage,

396
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,983
but it's a completely different dish.

397
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,653
I said plundering
was the only thing you could do,

398
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,197
but orcs can be pretty decent, too.

399
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,157
Shut up.

400
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,367
Um...

401
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,246
You asked me why I was trying
to reach the depths of the dungeon.

402
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,291
You see, my sister
was eaten by the Red Dragon.

403
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,668
That's why I'm going after the Dragon.

404
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,882
If you will tell us where it is,
we'll defeat the Red Dragon.

405
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,260
We won't involve your settlement at all.

406
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:12,600
I promise.

407
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,816
Hey, bring me a map.

408
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,733
Got it.

409
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,820
It's two floors under this one.

410
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,322
Last time I saw it, it was around
the west residential area.

411
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,282
Thank you.

412
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,958
From now on,
I'll think about the possibility

413
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,127
of gaining this dungeon as I explore it.

414
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:43,089
It's tough to imagine a guy
who gets captured by an orc

415
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,966
and bakes bread will become a king.

416
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,386
{\an8}But good luck.

417
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,013
It tastes really good.

418
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,938
You know, that cabbage
was grown on the back of a Golem.

419
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,654
<i>Even though people have varying views,
they all experience hunger.</i>

420
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:14,162
<i>It may only be dungeon food,
but it's still dungeon food.</i>
