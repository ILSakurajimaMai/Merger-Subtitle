00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:26,834
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,885
This one isn't dead. Just paralyzed.

3
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:38,304
On this floor, of all places?
Can you revive him?

4
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:39,639
Not sure.

5
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,777
Good. Looks like you're revived.

6
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:59,617
We were wiped out?

7
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:01,994
My necklace is gone.

8
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,372
My coins are gone, too.

9
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:06,499
And so are all the jewels.

10
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,544
We lost some of our belongings.

11
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:10,962
Do you know anything about it?

12
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:13,756
No doubt about it.
They were taken out by Treasure Bugs.

13
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,674
Shh!

14
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,634
Nah, we don't know a thing.

15
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:19,720
We found you all
lined up nicely on the ground.

16
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:23,474
Some folks must have
passed here before we did.

17
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:25,810
A strand of hair.

18
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:28,479
It's magic to ward off ghosts.

19
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,566
Someone definitely
came in contact with us.

20
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:35,736
An elf...

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,738
A tall-man...

22
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:41,242
{\an8}A half-foot... And a dwarf.

23
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:43,995
They had a meal here.

24
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:45,580
A meal?

25
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:47,373
They sure have some nerve.

26
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,374
Let's go after them.

27
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:49,959
Hold up.

28
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:52,503
We're not a charity, you know.

29
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,507
Here.

30
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:57,758
Thanks.

31
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,013
Why didn't you tell them?

32
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:03,472
It's simple.

33
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,850
The more corpses, the better.

34
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:13,774
I really want to wash my hair soon.

35
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,776
You'll feel refreshed
if you crop your hair.

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,571
There you go again, saying mean things.

37
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:21,574
Don't you want
to wash your beard as well, Senshi?

38
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,453
How long has it been
since you last washed it?

39
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:26,871
Let's give it a wash right now!

40
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:30,791
Your hair plays an important role
in magic, too.

41
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,545
Taking care of it is like warm-up.

42
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,466
With your beard like that,
my support magic might not work on you.

43
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:39,926
That would be just great.

44
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:43,304
Right! I have really nice soap.

45
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:46,474
I'll wash your beard with it and braid it!

46
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:51,812
Huh? I can't find it.

47
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,691
<i>Right, that day...</i>

48
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:58,903
No way! It was so expensive, though!

49
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,196
Let's go.

50
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:02,949
<i>On the fourth basement floor,</i>

51
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:06,118
<i>there is a lake formed
by underground water</i>

52
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,162
<i>flowing through carved-out bedrock.</i>

53
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,708
<i>The magic-infused water
emits a faint glow,</i>

54
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:15,294
<i>and far in the depths of the water,</i>

55
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,713
<i>the castle town can be seen
like a wavering illusion.</i>

56
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,968
How do you usually explore
the fourth floor, Senshi?

57
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:25,638
I fish and set traps around here.

58
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,139
That's about it.

59
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:29,976
How do you fellows get through this place?

60
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,853
With magic, of course.

61
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:35,439
I use this to do this and...

62
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:37,733
There!

63
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:41,904
We walk across on water.

64
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,073
N...

65
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:44,991
N...?

66
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:46,993
No!

67
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,120
No!

68
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:50,746
- No!
- No need to get so upset.

69
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,957
- No!
- This won't work.

70
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,875
{\an8}Let's tie a rope around him
and drag him along.

71
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,002
{\an8}No.

72
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,713
Put a spell on him
while I'm holding him down.

73
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,464
- What?
- With his armor--

74
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:04,260
With his armor, it's the only way
to get him across the water.

75
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,262
It's too dangerous to take a boat.

76
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:10,141
People easily fall for the path of ease.

77
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:13,728
It takes only a moment to get rusty,
but it takes a long, long time to--

78
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:14,645
There!

79
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,024
See? It wasn't such a big deal, was it?

80
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:19,400
Y-You...!

81
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:23,529
I don't get it.
Why do you hate magic so much?

82
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:27,199
You people are too casual
when it comes to using magic.

83
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:29,160
That's something I don't understand.

84
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:30,745
Now, now.

85
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:32,288
What's done is done.

86
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:34,915
You might actually like it.

87
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:39,545
- Huh?
- Huh?

88
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:41,213
W-Why?

89
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:43,299
Why isn't my magic working
as well as it should?

90
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:44,800
This must be it.

91
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:46,677
Ugh, is this an insulator?

92
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,722
It's soaked with the oils
and blood of various monsters.

93
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:50,848
Ew!

94
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:52,308
Wash it off quickly!

95
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:54,351
I'm not sure
if it will come off with just water...

96
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,728
No need.

97
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,690
I will get across the water in my own way.

98
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:00,941
Huh?

99
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:02,318
Are you gonna build a boat?

100
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,944
You'll sink like a stone in no time.

101
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:07,490
No, he must have some amazing plan.

102
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:09,658
You sure have a lot of confidence in him.

103
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:10,951
I don't get it.

104
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:12,453
Watch me.

105
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,083
- Is that the outer shell of a Mimic?
- Shh!

106
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,972
A Kelpie!

107
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:33,682
Watch out! Get back!

108
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,684
It's fine. It's harmless.

109
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:40,314
Anne is a horse
that always shows up whenever I fish.

110
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:41,232
Anne?

111
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:45,736
For a while now, I've been wondering
if I could use her to get across the lake.

112
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,113
- What?
- What?

113
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:51,242
Perhaps I can use the Mimic's shell
to steer her somehow.

114
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:54,120
T-That's...

115
00:06:54,203 --> 00:06:55,704
so cool!

116
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:56,747
{\an8}THIS SCREAMS ADVENTURE

117
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:58,249
I'm against it.

118
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:02,878
I think it'd be more practical
to use its guts to make a float.

119
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:05,047
H-How can you say that?

120
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:07,007
How cruel of you!

121
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:09,135
Monsters are dangerous.

122
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:11,387
Especially ones that are charming.

123
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:15,015
Kelpies make you lower your guard
and entice you into the water.

124
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:18,394
You can never know
what's going on in a monster's mind.

125
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:22,231
I've known Anne for a long time,
just like I've known the golems.

126
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:24,900
I know her much better than you.

127
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:29,321
Why does everyone
have a soft spot for mammals

128
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:32,324
when they won't let me grow
a Man-eating Plant?

129
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,244
Do you really not know why?

130
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:37,913
Let's go, Anne!

131
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:44,420
- Senshi!
- Senshi!

132
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:45,588
- Marcille!
- Huh?

133
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:55,556
<i>Anne...</i>

134
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,314
<i>Stop it, Anne!</i>

135
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:09,487
Laios!

136
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,201
Forgive me, Anne.

137
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:24,960
No way.

138
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,004
No way!

139
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:29,465
Please no!

140
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:40,476
So, she was waiting for me
to get on her back?

141
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,687
But she could've attacked me
whenever she wanted.

142
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:44,647
I don't know.

143
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,942
There's no knowing
what a monster is thinking.

144
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,653
I don't understand.

145
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:52,446
I don't understand at all.

146
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,245
You must be cold.

147
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,372
I'll start a fire right now.

148
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:03,832
Hey!

149
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,002
You were that fond of her,
and now you're going to eat her?

150
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:09,213
Unbelievable.

151
00:09:09,296 --> 00:09:10,256
Why, though?

152
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:12,299
Can I help?

153
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:14,510
No.

154
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,845
I'll do it on my own.

155
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:24,520
Hey.

156
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:28,274
Can I get some of the fat?

157
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,110
What brought this on?

158
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:34,446
Just an idea.

159
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,454
What on earth are we doing here?

160
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:43,872
Chilchuck.

161
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,834
Something is floating over there.

162
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,377
It better not be people.

163
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,503
Let's go and take a look.

164
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,630
What? I'd rather not.

165
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,886
What are these white things?

166
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,971
It's grain.

167
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,806
Looks like it's been spilled.

168
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,850
And here are the owners.

169
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:05,769
Let's draw them out of the water.

170
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:07,563
What is it?

171
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:10,566
Doesn't his face seem familiar?

172
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,567
Nope.

173
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:14,445
Oh, I know this kobold!

174
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,614
We found him dead
on the third basement floor.

175
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:18,782
How did they get ahead of us?

176
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:28,208
So, they met a Mermaid
and killed each other.

177
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:30,794
{\an8}The poor... things...

178
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:35,924
Chilchuck?

179
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:38,719
Chil! Chilchuck!

180
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:42,556
Chil!

181
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:17,466
They never let me finish the song,

182
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:19,551
even though
I took the trouble of remembering it.

183
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:24,264
That should do it.

184
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:28,060
We shouldn't let
the scattered grain go to waste.

185
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:29,436
Let's gather the grain for them.

186
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,021
That's going too far.

187
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:33,065
Then let's take them for ourselves.

188
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:34,817
It'll make Marcille happy.

189
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,652
<i>Poor Marcille.</i>

190
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:42,950
No!

191
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:44,868
I didn't say anything yet.

192
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:47,830
You promised not to go for demi-humans!

193
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:50,833
{\an8}Demi-humans...

194
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,960
What are they?

195
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,086
What do you mean?

196
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:56,088
<i>Mermaids come in different forms.</i>

197
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:58,090
<i>Some are mammals,
while others are more like fish.</i>

198
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,134
This one's in the fish category.

199
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:02,553
It lays eggs, so it doesn't have
a belly button or nipples.

200
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:03,595
Instead, it has gills.

201
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,558
They're farther removed
from humans than cows or pigs.

202
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,518
What?

203
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:12,980
- No way!
- What?!

204
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:14,857
Why, though?

205
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,484
Why can we eat cow but not a Fish-man?

206
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,486
It just doesn't feel right.

207
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,488
{\an8}Feel?

208
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:23,824
Feel, huh?

209
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:28,704
They're still at it.

210
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:31,665
I'm starting to feel hungry,
so how about we whip something up?

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,252
<i>Throw the grains in water
and put it over a fire.</i>

212
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:38,130
<i>Toss in some flaked Mimic
and waterweeds, then--</i>

213
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:39,506
Wait a minute.

214
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,884
That's the stuff that was growing
on the Fish-man's head.

215
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:45,387
Yeah, but this is just a normal plant.

216
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:47,639
The Fish-men use it to camouflage.

217
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:51,185
Without it, they'd look even more fishy.

218
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:54,480
Does it still upset your feelings?

219
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:56,523
<i>This is starting to become a bother.</i>

220
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:59,276
Fine. Have it your way.

221
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:05,032
<i>I think I might've made
an error in judgment just now.</i>

222
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,617
All right. It's ready.

223
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,036
PORRIDGE WITH SCATTERED BARLEY

224
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,872
Marcille, Senshi, let's have lunch.

225
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:14,124
Is it that time already?

226
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,543
Where did you manage to find some grains?

227
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:19,254
I scavenged them
from the fallen adventurers over there.

228
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:20,797
What on earth were you thinking?

229
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,551
<i>Good question.
I knew Marcille wouldn't disappoint.</i>

230
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:27,137
But you already cooked them, so.

231
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:29,139
I'll dig right in!

232
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:39,107
Hmm, there's a pop in the texture.

233
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:40,484
What is it?

234
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:41,777
Probably fish eggs.

235
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,862
They must've been on the water weeds.

236
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,114
It tastes good.

237
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,075
I know, right?

238
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:49,660
I'm glad I added them.

239
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:51,328
Come with me.

240
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:52,829
Hey!

241
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:55,123
Those were a Fish-man's eggs,
weren't they?

242
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,751
I've heard Fish-men have
a habit of laying their eggs on waterweeds

243
00:13:57,834 --> 00:14:00,337
that they wear on their heads
to protect them or something!

244
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:02,047
What's the matter?

245
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:03,799
Marcille.

246
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,719
Does it taste good?

247
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:11,765
Yeah!

248
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:17,980
Senshi.

249
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:20,732
This is for you.

250
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,486
I made soap using the Kelpie's fat.

251
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,156
Kelpie's fat is often used as hair oil,

252
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,242
but it can also be used
for clothes and dishes.

253
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:35,539
Can I use it right now?

254
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:38,250
It's still being saponified,
so I'm not sure.

255
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,127
I want to give it a try.

256
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,004
You put a lot of effort
into making it, right?

257
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,840
Okay.

258
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:26,298
Thank goodness!

259
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:28,425
Now, we can move ahead together.

260
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:30,969
I see.

261
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,764
Now that it's come to this,
I've realized something.

262
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:38,685
Walking on water
actually feels quite nice.

263
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,813
Thank you, Marcille.

264
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:47,194
Some soap got into my eye.

265
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:00,248
Leave this to me.

266
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,709
I'll wipe them out!

267
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:03,961
Don't!

268
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,134
- Watch out!
- Ow!

269
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,138
I told you not to!

270
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:17,724
An underwater explosion
kills too many of them!

271
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:18,642
What?

272
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:22,562
These Blade Fish can be stewed,
grilled, steamed,

273
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:25,232
dried, smoked, or eaten raw.

274
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,651
They're delicious
no matter how you prepare them.

275
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,696
But they're a food source
for other monsters as well.

276
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,908
If their population decreases,
it could disrupt the dungeon's ecosystem.

277
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:37,577
So you should get them one at a time.

278
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:40,038
What? You're asking too much!

279
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:41,623
Now that I think about it,

280
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:44,292
it seems like there are fewer
mid-sized monsters around than usual.

281
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:45,293
See?

282
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:48,005
I can't just go easy on them, though.

283
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:49,923
Not when they're trying to kill us.

284
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:53,427
If anything,
there are more Blade Fish than usual.

285
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,554
I don't think there's anything
to be concerned about.

286
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:57,681
But what if the monsters end up starving?

287
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:00,809
I don't want to die
just to protect their ecosystem!

288
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:08,358
You people are too quick
to take the easy path.

289
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,571
What? Then you should try
taking them out one by one.

290
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:13,739
It's hard, you know!

291
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:18,285
You should think about the ecosystem more...

292
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,581
What's going on?

293
00:17:22,664 --> 00:17:23,749
Senshi!

294
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,670
What was that all about?
They just passed by us.

295
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:30,589
Are you hurt?

296
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:33,300
Senshi?

297
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,678
Something is approaching.

298
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:37,763
What?

299
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,189
You're kidding, right?

300
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:49,441
It's way too huge!

301
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:00,577
A squid?

302
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,287
Or is it an octopus?

303
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,580
It's a Kraken!

304
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:06,291
It's a big monster to begin with,

305
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:08,543
but this one's a few times larger
than the usual ones!

306
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:10,962
It's so cool!

307
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,506
What do we do?

308
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,382
If we act rashly, it's gonna get us!

309
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:15,884
We'll draw its attention!

310
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:17,594
I'm counting on you, Marcille.

311
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:20,097
Magic again?

312
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,974
Relax. I'll strike it this time.

313
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:27,604
Here it comes!

314
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,773
Don't stop running!

315
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:38,323
Right there!

316
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:42,285
I did it!

317
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:53,171
No way! It didn't take a hit!

318
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,884
Using a weapon on it will only
slice through its outer skin at most.

319
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,488
There must be magic I can use...

320
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:19,865
Marcille!

321
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,617
- Use your magic again.
- What?

322
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:25,203
I can't pull off such a powerful magic
in quick succession.

323
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,121
No.

324
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:27,706
This will do.

325
00:19:28,874 --> 00:19:31,626
I mean, this is your first encounter
with a Kraken, right?

326
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:34,796
Do you even know
what kind of monster it is?

327
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,256
- I don't.
- What?

328
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,425
I don't know much about Krakens,

329
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:41,011
but I have cleaned
squids and octopuses before.

330
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:43,889
Watch out, Marcille!

331
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,140
It's heading your way!

332
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,520
Water-Walk!

333
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,412
To kill a squid or an octopus,

334
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:09,664
stab it right between the eyes!

335
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,677
Amazing.

336
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:24,429
Huh?

337
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:25,722
Where's Laios?

338
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,185
Hey. I'm over here.

339
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:36,316
Looks like this creature was devouring
all the medium-sized monsters.

340
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:39,527
Both of you, come here.

341
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,325
You should try cleaning a cephalopod
at least once.

342
00:20:46,534 --> 00:20:49,704
Stab squids and octopuses here
to kill them neatly.

343
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:51,957
Do squids and octopuses taste good?

344
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,417
No way! You've never tried them?

345
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,461
They taste really good, you know!

346
00:20:56,544 --> 00:21:01,091
You can stew, grill, steam, dry, smoke,
or even enjoy them raw.

347
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,969
{\an8}They really taste great
no matter how you cook them!

348
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:07,722
I know a good place,
so I'll show you there next time.

349
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:09,140
Can't I try one now?

350
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:11,977
I dug my own grave!

351
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:14,980
Wow, this is so weird!

352
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:16,982
How do I eat this?

353
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:19,234
Let's try salting it.

354
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:24,364
- It stinks.
- Well, well!

355
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:26,408
It tastes awfully bitter.

356
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:28,618
It's making my mouth tingle.

357
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:31,496
Marcille, do you really
eat this in various dishes?

358
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:34,499
No, I don't!
That's a weird misunderstanding!

359
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,636
How marvelous!

360
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,556
A big parasite for a big monster!

361
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:51,766
Ew, disgusting!

362
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,934
Throw it away now!

363
00:21:53,518 --> 00:21:54,769
What's all the fuss about?

364
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:57,188
Most creatures
have parasitic worms inside them.

365
00:21:57,272 --> 00:22:00,650
And many of them end up in our meals, too.

366
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,319
You didn't have to tell me that!

367
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:05,196
Well, if we cook it,
we should be able to eat this as well.

368
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,364
No!

369
00:22:06,448 --> 00:22:08,658
That's one way of looking at it.

370
00:22:08,742 --> 00:22:10,452
I said no!

371
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:31,014
Let's try broiling these with some sauce.

372
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:38,521
It's upsetting how amazing it smells!

373
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:48,239
It's done!

374
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,909
BROILED AND GLAZED
GIANT PARASITIC WORM

375
00:22:56,748 --> 00:22:57,999
It's good!

376
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:02,003
I can't quite put it into words,
but it's really soft and delicious!

377
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:04,839
It's got a bit of a slime,
but it's quite meaty.

378
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:10,178
I-It's good.

379
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:11,346
Not bad.

380
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,141
This has a delicious taste
that's unlike your typical fish.

381
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:17,477
Isn't it even better
than squid or octopus?

382
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,479
That's not...

383
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:22,732
true, probably.

384
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:26,277
I'm pretty sure this would be delicious,
no matter how you prepare it as well.

385
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,655
I had a bite of it raw,
but it went down nicely.

386
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:30,490
Hold on, you ate it raw?

387
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:32,117
Just a little.

388
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,952
It was already dead, so it should be fine.

389
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:37,747
The fish are eating the Kraken.

390
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:42,252
That should help the medium-sized monsters
slowly come back.

391
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,257
My stomach...

392
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,260
Ow...

393
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:52,637
What's the matter? Are you okay?

394
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,847
Well, well...

395
00:23:54,347 --> 00:23:56,224
It's just as I thought.

396
00:23:56,307 --> 00:24:00,770
Laios, what you have is the parasite
that was inside the giant parasitic worm.

397
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:05,108
<i>It's the same kind
you find in your average fish, too.</i>

398
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:06,985
<i>I spotted one
when I was cleaning the big worm.</i>

399
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:08,027
<i>It can't be...</i>

400
00:24:08,611 --> 00:24:10,155
It won't parasite on a human,

401
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:13,032
but it does make a hole in your stomach,
which can be very painful.

402
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:15,869
All you can do is wait for it to die.

403
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,539
I think I might die first.

404
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:22,083
Why not throw a healing spell
on him every now and then?

405
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,293
Good idea.

406
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:25,420
But I see now.

407
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:28,173
<i>The Fish-men eat the Blade Fish,</i>

408
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:30,508
<i>and the Kraken eats the Fish-men.</i>

409
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:32,886
<i>We took down the Kraken,</i>

410
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:34,929
<i>and the little fish feast on its flesh.</i>

411
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:38,850
<i>Laios ate the parasitic worm
inside the Kraken,</i>

412
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:42,187
<i>and the parasite within that worm
ended up poking a hole in Laios' stomach.</i>

413
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:48,359
I guess it was a little arrogant of me
to try to protect the ecosystem.

414
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:53,448
Right from the start, we were already
a part of the dungeon's circle of life.

415
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,452
<i>Laios attempted to speak,</i>

416
00:24:57,535 --> 00:25:02,457
<i>but the excruciating pain and nausea
left his mind completely empty.</i>

417
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:07,295
<i>The agony, which felt as if knives
were slicing through his insides,</i>

418
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:08,546
<i>persisted all night.</i>

419
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:14,135
<i>And he vowed
never to eat a parasitic worm raw again.</i>
