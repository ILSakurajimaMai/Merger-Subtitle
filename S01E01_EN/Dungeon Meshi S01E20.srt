1
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,857
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,010
I don't recognize this road.

3
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,554
This <i>is</i> the way.

4
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,847
Are you sure?

5
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,101
Pick up the pace! Get a move on!

6
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,269
I think we're stuck.

7
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,645
Don't push!

8
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,272
-Hey!
-Watch out--

9
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,113
This open space
is where we fought the Red Dragon!

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,994
You made it all the way here
on your last expedition?

11
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:00,620
Yeah.

12
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,874
For a long time, this spot
was believed to be the deepest point.

13
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,086
But recently, they found a door nearby
that seems to go even deeper.

14
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,882
It's engraved with a design,
and they think it opens with magic.

15
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,886
<i>We came to sketch the design
for the Lord of the Island, but…</i>

16
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,434
<i>You encountered the Red Dragon
and were forced to retreat.</i>

17
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,729
All right, let's try our luck.

18
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,106
I think we were over there last time.

19
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,110
I found our gear!

20
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,904
It's been ransacked.

21
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,113
No!

22
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,366
Yes!

23
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,035
I found my sleeping bag!

24
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,495
Great. My underwear's still here too.

25
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,081
Those are things you prioritize
over your valuables?

26
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,251
All our food is gone,

27
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,337
but everything else seems untouched.

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,213
Guess it was monsters that did this.

29
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,590
I'm so glad.

30
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,717
Now I can sleep warm tonight--

31
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,805
That's not good.

32
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,099
Let's find a place to rest for a bit.

33
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,601
I want to organize my gear too.

34
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,146
Maybe the snow slows down the Cleaners.

35
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,273
They've gotten at my soap.

36
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,316
Hey, none of that.

37
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,443
Show me whatever you just stashed away.

38
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,198
Here, Marcille.

39
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,282
Ow.

40
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,118
Talk about an untrained beast-man.

41
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,788
No wonder they slapped that collar on you.

42
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,208
You're called a half-foot, right?

43
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,002
I've never seen your kind in the East.

44
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,129
I had to come here
to learn about you folks.

45
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,174
That odd name for your race.

46
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:41,054
I heard it's because lots of you
got a foot lopped off for stealing.

47
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,058
Come on, you two, cut it out.

48
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,060
Marcille!

49
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,311
Come here!

50
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,983
It's a fish!

51
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,569
Is there a way to cut out
just this section?

52
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,823
Maybe with a magic circle…

53
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,867
Right. Want to give it a shot, Laios?

54
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,911
I'll show you how to draw a magic circle.

55
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,789
How's your mana sickness been lately?

56
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,624
I don't get so dizzy anymore.

57
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,295
<i>The hallucinations
are getting stronger, though.</i>

58
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,715
<i>It's fish I used to catch
on the fourth floor.</i>

59
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,220
<i>The water from the upper floors
has flowed down here and froze.</i>

60
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,974
<i>Looks like all sorts of stuff
end up in the stream.</i>

61
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,477
And now the circle's ready.

62
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,313
How do you feel?

63
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,981
A little tired.

64
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,108
I'll activate it then.

65
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:39,529
Imagine it as pouring water
into the symbols you've etched.

66
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,367
What on earth?

67
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,994
The ground, it's…

68
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,249
A-A monster?

69
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,876
An Ice Golem?

70
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,381
<i>I see.</i>

71
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,139
Hey! Above you!

72
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,140
Watch out!

73
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,478
Laios!

74
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,950
So how do we take this thing down?

75
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,620
The only way to stop Golems
is by breaking their core!

76
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,746
Their core?

77
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,872
And where do I find that?

78
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,882
Hey! Where's the core?

79
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,550
Hang on a second!

80
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,844
<i>Is that its core? No, it's just a fish.</i>

81
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,971
<i>There's too much junk in there to tell.</i>

82
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:50,100
Hey! Keep that thing distracted
and buy me some time!

83
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,351
I can't spot the core yet!

84
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,477
Huh?!

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,357
<i>That jerk better not be making stuff up
to bring me down.</i>

86
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,156
The snow!

87
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,293
<i>It stopped.</i>

88
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,515
Hey, you done yet?

89
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,225
How much longer do I have to keep this up?

90
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,977
That's good, Izutsumi. Well done!

91
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,110
Good. Perfect!

92
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,863
You better not be messing around!

93
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,365
No, idiot. Check where my arrow landed.

94
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,497
Also, I can use projectiles,

95
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,458
but I can't do much damage with them.

96
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,003
So don't count on me in a battle!

97
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,337
I'll let you handle the rest!

98
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,050
<i>Oh, well.</i>

99
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,428
<i>Now that I know how to take it down…</i>

100
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,207
Seems like I'm the only one here
who's actually useful.

101
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,542
The rest of you are just…

102
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,760
Is everyone okay?

103
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,678
It'll warm up soon.

104
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,474
That magic circle can get pretty hot,
so watch out for burns.

105
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,393
Take off your wet clothes
and dry them out.

106
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,436
You too.

107
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,688
I'll give you some cover.

108
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,024
Laios, can you change on your own?

109
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,528
Someone lend him a hand.

110
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,448
No need to shield me.

111
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,450
But you can't just…

112
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:25,004
It's not like anyone would be excited
to see a beast get naked.

113
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,839
What's the big idea?

114
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,634
I just didn't want you catching a chill.

115
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,845
At least let me count her nipples,
or see the base of her tail!

116
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,936
It's starting to get warm.

117
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,647
Let's prepare something hot.

118
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,567
We've got to thaw this out.

119
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,695
Maybe I can melt it over the magic circle.

120
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,949
Too close.

121
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,951
This is nice, though.

122
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,077
It feels like a sauna.

123
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,830
It's been ages since we had a bath.

124
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,415
Let's sweat it out!

125
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,213
That thing comes off?

126
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,590
Why am I blindfolded?

127
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,468
<i>I'll clean the fish, then use the head
and bones to brew up some broth.</i>

128
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,971
We might end up smelling like fish.

129
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,474
<i>Thinly slice the mushrooms and Nightmares.</i>

130
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:22,228
<i>Give the Shapeshifter meat a quick boil
to skim off any scum.</i>

131
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,564
<i>Whisk the Harpy egg,</i>

132
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,817
<i>then mix it in with the broth
and other ingredients.</i>

133
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,989
<i>Pour it all into cups,</i>

134
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,242
<i>set them in a pot
with the Ice Golem fragments,</i>

135
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,285
<i>and heat it up.</i>

136
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,246
Look. I made this out of her shed hair.

137
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,247
How bored are you?

138
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,626
Finally, garnish with Mandrake leaves.

139
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,918
And it's done--

140
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,420
Hey!

141
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,839
You can't just start eating on your own.

142
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,425
Wait until everyone is at the table.

143
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,593
Why not?

144
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,137
I took down the enemy all by myself!

145
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,681
I deserve to eat first!

146
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,684
Meals begin when everyone's present.

147
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,271
Chilchuck, Laios went outside.
Can you go fetch him?

148
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,189
Got it.

149
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,192
This feels great.

150
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,693
Is this guy for real?

151
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,862
ICE GOLEM SAVORY EGG CUSTARD

152
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,697
AND COOKED FISH
TAKEN FROM THE ICE GOLEM

153
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,950
All right, now that we're all here,

154
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,661
let's start eating!

155
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,953
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

156
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,456
It's pudding.

157
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,125
Sorry, Marcille.

158
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,335
Yum!

159
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,671
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

160
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,838
Hey, Izutsumi.

161
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,507
What is it?

162
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,716
This is for you.

163
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,427
I patched up a torn bag.

164
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:37,553
You can use it.

165
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,474
Listen.

166
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,018
I apologize for calling you a beast.

167
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,312
I've got a sharp tongue.

168
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,524
Traveling together
with a bunch of strangers

169
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,151
can feel suffocating
and annoying at first.

170
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,696
But once you get used to it,
there are perks.

171
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,865
You can get others
to handle stuff you can't.

172
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,418
-That was delicious.
-That was delicious.

173
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,545
Yeah.

174
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,882
Hey, are you done yet?

175
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,843
Just a little longer.

176
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,262
Like this and that…

177
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,513
There we go!

178
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,182
Ta-da!

179
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,937
These are Namari's clothes,
but don't they suit her perfectly?

180
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,439
They're hard to move in.

181
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,816
It took some time to adjust them.

182
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,359
I got all chilled again.

183
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,735
I'm sorry, okay?

184
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,862
Well, let's hit the road.

185
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,779
Wait.

186
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,410
These are Mandrakes boiled sweet.

187
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,413
I figured they'd make
for good travel food.

188
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,293
Hey.

189
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,420
Have it.

190
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,256
That's yours.

191
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,175
I don't want it.

192
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,301
Why not?

193
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,886
It's really tasty.

194
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,304
I said I don't want it.

195
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,431
No, have a bite at least.

196
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,308
-Try it!
-I said no!

197
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,854
H-How mean!

198
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,315
Why did she have
to draw blood in this situation?

199
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,651
Just leave her be.
She'll eat when she's hungry.

200
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,321
Why don't you want it?

201
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,864
Because it's a monster.

202
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,075
Everyone says that, but how is it
different from eating animals?

203
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,746
If you eat monsters, you catch
strange diseases and turn into one!

204
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,830
That's why I won't eat it!

205
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,751
If eating monsters turned you into them,
it would be a simple story.

206
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,629
It's the idea of becoming impure.

207
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,797
It's not exactly logical,

208
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,218
but I think most people, myself included,
avoid them for that reason.

209
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,471
It feels like you're absorbing
something bad in some way.

210
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,850
And with new diseases popping up
from creatures close to humans,

211
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,479
I don't think vague aversion
should be brushed off so lightly.

212
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,816
This is really good!

213
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:01,739
But what did you do before
when you were served food you didn't like?

214
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,824
Before?

215
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,370
Ugh!

216
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,999
Tade, you can have this.

217
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,753
Thanks, Izu… I mean, Asebi!

218
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,463
It never happened.

219
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,631
I don't believe you.

220
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,258
Let's go, you two!

221
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,771
The blizzard doesn't seem to be easing up.

222
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,566
Maybe we should just camp here for today.

223
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm hungry too.

224
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,695
Senshi looks worn out as well.

225
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,780
Let's whip something up ourselves.

226
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,157
What ingredients do we have left?

227
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,201
Nightmares, Mandrakes,

228
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,619
eggs, mushrooms, and…

229
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,537
What's this?

230
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,080
Any fish?

231
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,582
No, no more fish.

232
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,749
Rice then.

233
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,294
We're running low on rice too.

234
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,963
Don't you have anything better than this?

235
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,172
This is all we've got.

236
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,049
Liar! You're hiding stuff!

237
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,011
You can't afford to be
a picky eater in the dungeon.

238
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,679
You should get used to it quickly.

239
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,597
No!

240
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,432
I only eat what I want to eat!

241
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,100
Listen, Izutsumi.

242
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,436
Eating monsters doesn't turn you into one.

243
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>Has anyone turned into a sheep
or pig after eating them?</i>

244
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,027
<i>If a blind person eats an eyeball,
does that mean they'll see again?</i>

245
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,447
<i>Sheep only eat grass,
but do they turn into plants?</i>

246
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,367
Food and nutrition
are more complex than that.

247
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,703
That's why people work hard to experiment.

248
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,954
Shut up!

249
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,290
What do you call that then?

250
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,207
That?

251
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,672
A sheep is growing into a tree.

252
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,591
It's a Barometz.

253
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,260
Why did it have to show up now?

254
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,762
Listen, Izutsumi.

255
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,263
That's a plant that always--

256
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,766
Shut up! I'm sick of your talk!

257
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,892
That's it.

258
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,769
I'm going to get that sheep.

259
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,145
What's a Barometz?

260
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,605
Is it some kind of monster?

261
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,024
It's a monster all right,
but it's harmless.

262
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,025
Although,

263
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,986
they do tend to attract carnivores.

264
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,697
Be careful, Izutsumi.

265
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,157
<i>Who does he think he's talking to?</i>

266
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,536
It's not safe to stay here.

267
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,664
-Let's harvest it quickly and--
-They're here.

268
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,665
Huh?

269
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,504
Dammit. Dire Wolves!

270
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,928
M-My staff!

271
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,059
Hold up!

272
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,560
Where are you going?

273
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,145
I hate dogs.

274
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,022
They're smelly, noisy, and persistent.

275
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,526
I-Is that reason enough
to just go off on your own?

276
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,736
I left you guys to deal with them.

277
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,991
You guys said friends are supposed
to make up for each other.

278
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,077
That's not quite what we meant.

279
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,370
Then what did you mean?

280
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,331
You didn't join in on the fight
with the Golem back there.

281
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,917
It's true we left that to you,

282
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,836
but not because of personal preferences.

283
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,839
Hey, let's turn back.

284
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,090
No.

285
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,260
<i>I'm catching a whiff of fire in the wind.</i>

286
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,345
<i>If I follow it, I can find my way back.</i>

287
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,098
Wait!

288
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,227
<i>The scent's stronger to the right,</i>

289
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,730
<i>but the path looks rough,
so I'll go this way.</i>

290
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,982
Where are you heading?
Is this the right way?

291
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,651
I'll take the path I want.

292
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,611
You should do the same.

293
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,239
Why don't you do as you like more?

294
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,949
You hate eating monsters,

295
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,243
and yet you still do it.

296
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,162
It doesn't make sense.

297
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:37,747
Well…

298
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,876
It seems the wolves have come after us.

299
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,127
Should we fight them here?

300
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,588
I can use explosive spells,

301
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,548
but I don't have my staff with me.

302
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,675
And it's risky to cast them
in such a confined space.

303
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,886
Maybe I can stun them with a bright light.

304
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,554
I'll run and shake them off.

305
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,268
What?!

306
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,409
Ow!

307
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,621
Owie.

308
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,664
Ow.

309
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,251
Hey, Asebi!

310
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,923
You made Tade clear off the snow
from the roof of the training hall.

311
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:29,924
I didn't.

312
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,383
Don't lie to me!

313
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,677
She fell from the roof while doing it.

314
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,263
Unlike you, she's clumsy,

315
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,808
so don't push tasks you dislike onto her!

316
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,143
You should show more gratitude to us
for taking you in.

317
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,273
Hey, Tade.

318
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,568
Why did you go and do something
I never asked you to do?

319
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,694
You really are dumb.

320
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,614
But Tade…

321
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,369
<i>What was it she said that day?</i>

322
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,329
Never mind.

323
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,752
<i>I slipped up.</i>

324
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,296
<i>The explosion shifted
the wind's direction,</i>

325
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,756
<i>and I failed to notice.</i>

326
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,721
Close… your eyes.

327
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,433
Close your eyes.

328
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,811
Close them!

329
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,028
T-Too close!

330
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,788
Izutsumi!

331
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,790
Are you alive?

332
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,834
Ow!

333
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,210
Your arm is broken.

334
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,378
Can you walk?

335
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,880
Let's rejoin the others.

336
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,054
Listen.

337
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,808
You asked me why I eat monsters,

338
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,394
and I've been thinking about it.

339
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,063
I have my goals and objectives.

340
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,732
I want to help my friend

341
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,067
and learn more about magic.

342
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:16,113
So, I'm pushing toward those goals.

343
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,532
Along the way,
I encounter things I dislike.

344
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,535
Things that are bothersome,
things that tire me,

345
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,787
and having to eat things I'd rather not.

346
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,124
Individually, none of it is a big deal.

347
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,794
But if I avoid everything I dislike,

348
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,130
I'll stray further and further
from my path.

349
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,258
Just like what's happening to us now.

350
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,888
Why did you choose
to come along with us, Izutsumi?

351
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,850
Because you said that
if we met the lunatic magician,

352
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,436
there might be a chance
to break the curse on me.

353
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,395
It's this way!

354
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,064
Exactly.

355
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,108
That's why you need to be ready
to take a few shortcuts.

356
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,742
Izutsumi! Marcille!

357
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,868
Are you okay?

358
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,079
What about you guys?

359
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,373
We were in a bit of a fix,

360
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,960
<i>but Laios managed to scare them off,
so we're safe.</i>

361
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,129
<i>Most of the wolves
went after Marcille, anyway.</i>

362
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,090
Are you hurt?

363
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,800
It seems she broke her arm.

364
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,677
I'll use recovery magic on her

365
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,804
while I set it back into place,
so lend me a hand.

366
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,895
You did great.

367
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,398
The recovery magic hurt more.

368
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,067
I was hoping to harvest a Barometz,

369
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,112
but the wolves made off
with the mature one.

370
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,282
All that was left was this unripe fruit.

371
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,993
Let's try cooking it.

372
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,211
There's a sheep inside the fruit.

373
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,379
I can't eat that!

374
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,132
It's not the same as the others,
ethically speaking. I can't eat that!

375
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,049
Yuck.

376
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,803
Slice the Barometz ribs
into appropriate sizes,

377
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,306
season them, and cook them.

378
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,559
When both sides are nicely browned,

379
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,937
pour in some wine,
cover with a lid, and let them steam.

380
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,858
Run the rind of the fruit
through hot water, remove the peel,

381
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,443
then chop it into chunks.

382
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,195
Add garlic and stew together.

383
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,949
Pour the finished sauce over the meat,

384
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,451
and it's done.

385
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,953
BAROMETZ BALUT (OR BAROMETZ CHOPS)

386
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,955
Here, cat girl.

387
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,290
This is yours.

388
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,001
It's got weird stuff in it.

389
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,296
That's the Barometz skin and shoots.

390
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,342
You should've grilled the meat on its own.

391
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,977
Barometz might look just like sheep,

392
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,854
but they taste like crab!

393
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,064
<i>So what?</i>

394
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,232
<i>It's delicious.</i>

395
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,860
<i>I never knew food this amazing existed.</i>

396
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,363
<i>Come to think of it…</i>

397
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,742
Tade, why did you go and do something
I never asked you to do?

398
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,660
You really are dumb.

399
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,704
Tade just wants

400
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,041
to be helpful to everyone.

401
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,125
Ow!

402
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,419
I mean, this place is pretty great.

403
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:21,381
We get three meals,
warm bedding, and baths too.

404
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,926
I can't risk being kicked out.

405
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,637
I'll do chores and anything else
to show them I'm useful!

406
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,723
Asebi,

407
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,894
don't lose your way just because
something is a bit bothersome.

408
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,567
And Lady Maizuru sometimes
rewards me with snacks.

409
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,736
That's what you're truly after, isn't it?

410
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,364
<i>Maybe she's right.</i>

411
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,700
<i>Sometimes you do end up
with something tasty out of it.</i>

412
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,706
Good for you, Izutsumi!

413
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,167
-Well done! Good girl!
-Good girl.

414
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,128
Cut it out… You…

415
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,756
What do you take me for, huh?!

416
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,843
I'll only eat when I have no other choice.

417
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,637
I won't be eating any vegetables
or monsters that taste bad, got it?

418
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,141
But you won't know if they taste bad
until you give them a try.

419
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,269
By the way, Marcille,
I noticed you're barely eating.

420
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,688
Do you really think
you can get away with not eating

421
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,648
after giving me that lecture?

422
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:25,112
<i>Marcille deeply regretted
blocking her own means of escape.</i>

423
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,531
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

424
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>
