1
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,862
MỸ VỊ HẦM NGỤC

2
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:39,416
Footsteps.

3
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,211
What a surprise.

4
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,879
They really are grilling meat.

5
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,676
I hope they're not criminals or that sort
who aren't allowed back on the surface.

6
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,427
We're just camping.

7
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:52,429
We mean no harm.

8
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:55,182
Wait a minute, I know that voice.

9
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,017
Just as I thought!

10
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,435
It's you, Laios!

11
00:01:58,435 --> 00:01:59,937
- Namari!
- Namari!

12
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:01,230
You know them?

13
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,690
They're my former party members.

14
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,859
Hey, it's been a while.

15
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,694
Well, I guess it's only been a week.

16
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:08,863
Oh, let me introduce these people.

17
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:12,366
These are my current employers,
Mr. and Mrs. Tansu.

18
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,119
They work as someone's personal scholars,

19
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:17,121
and they pay really well.

20
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:19,623
And these two are the twins,
Kaka and Kiki.

21
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,501
To be honest,
I can never remember who's who.

22
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:26,130
Namari, how can you act like this

23
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:29,008
after abandoning Falin?

24
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,551
Abandon?

25
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:34,513
I simply refused
to walk into the jaws of death for free.

26
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,224
You...

27
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,894
Marcille, take it easy.

28
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:43,063
Hey, don't push yourselves.

29
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:46,066
Falin wouldn't want
anything to happen to you.

30
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:47,735
Right.

31
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,904
Is there a healer in your party?

32
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,614
My friend needs treatment.

33
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,866
What do we get in return?

34
00:02:58,203 --> 00:02:59,455
We have Kelpie meat.

35
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:00,372
No, thanks!

36
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,249
Let's go, Namari.

37
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,461
Handing out charity in a dungeon
just sets you up to be taken advantage of.

38
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:08,631
Seriously, even that corpse
we stumbled upon on our way here

39
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:10,257
had their own revival fee with them.

40
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:12,760
Are you going to move on ahead?

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,137
There's an Undine roaming around,
and it's dangerous.

42
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:16,680
An Undine?

43
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,726
So, this girl
angered a water spirit, did she?

44
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:24,063
Don't underestimate us.

45
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:28,317
We gnomes have been living alongside
gods and spirits since ancient times.

46
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:34,531
To us, spirits are like neighbors,
not something to be afraid of.

47
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,535
Undine!

48
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,955
Oh, mighty water spirit!

49
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:44,124
Heed my voice and respond to me!

50
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,168
This isn't working.

51
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:50,339
Grandpa Tansu!

52
00:03:58,722 --> 00:03:59,640
It didn't work.

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,934
N-Namari!

54
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,602
Namari died!

55
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:05,145
She'll recover in no time.

56
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,941
<i>Ira Fa Lane Brete Lane Bretego.</i>

57
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,405
Damn you, you old geezer!

58
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,782
You're always using me as your shield!

59
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:19,868
That's why I compensate you handsomely!

60
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,537
Resurrection magic, huh?

61
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,999
It's a magic
I especially can't bring myself to like.

62
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,418
You're against resurrection?

63
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,421
It's not a pleasant sight to witness.

64
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:33,465
It's unnatural for the dead
to come back to life.

65
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:37,803
Outside the dungeon, sure,
but in here, it's normal.

66
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,054
It's not normal.

67
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:41,598
It's not normal, Laios.

68
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:43,100
That's right.

69
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:47,146
This dungeon
is under a very powerful enchantment.

70
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,108
<i>It binds your soul to your body.</i>

71
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:55,863
<i>So, no matter how damaged your body gets,
your soul is never released.</i>

72
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:58,824
<i>And once your injuries are mended,
you can be revived.</i>

73
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,659
In my perspective,

74
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,704
this isn't the dead coming back to life.

75
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,416
In this place, death itself is forbidden.

76
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:11,128
It is a truly dreadful curse.

77
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:12,838
But that aside,

78
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:16,717
I study such ancient spells.

79
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:20,095
I came here to investigate
a magic circle in this area,

80
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,849
but as you can see,
my escort isn't very dependable.

81
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,062
If you help me with my investigation,

82
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,355
I will heal your companion.

83
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:37,863
Deal.

84
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:40,741
Senshi and I will accompany you.

85
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:47,873
This should be the area.

86
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,043
Elven characters.

87
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:53,128
What terrible penmanship.

88
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,214
The roots are in the way. Remove them.

89
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:03,305
Laios, you still have that creepy sword?

90
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,432
I keep telling you, but--

91
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,768
"Use one from the shop," right? I know.

92
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,603
You have to get one crafted by a dwarf.

93
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,189
And avoid shops
that are tended by a half-foot.

94
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,024
And don't use the same scabbard.

95
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:14,942
And...

96
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:18,028
You should give your weapon
some care now and then!

97
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,613
I pity your axe!

98
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:23,617
You probably think
I'm being annoying, don't you?

99
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,576
No.

100
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,789
When it comes to handling weapons,
I trust you more than anyone else.

101
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:39,842
Stay back.

102
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:41,385
What is it?

103
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:42,594
There's a monster lurking.

104
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,012
Then kill it.

105
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,140
I don't know what or where it is.

106
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,892
Then how can you be certain
there's a monster?

107
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:50,310
J-Just a feeling.

108
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,478
Are you serious?

109
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,855
Mr. Tansu.

110
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:56,608
You should trust Laios
when he's like this.

111
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,653
I can't afford
to entertain a baseless suspicion.

112
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,281
If it's lurking, simply drag it out.

113
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:18,589
Oh, I see.

114
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:20,424
It's a Tentacles.

115
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:22,217
This isn't the time to admire it!

116
00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:24,761
Kiki! Hang in there!

117
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:26,138
Hey, don't just stand there!

118
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:28,015
Defeat the monster already!

119
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,641
Our weapons can't reach it.

120
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,393
Hurry up and do something!

121
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:34,855
What if we purposefully let ourselves
get caught to get up close?

122
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,149
Tentacles is part of the cnidarian family.

123
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,443
<i>If their feelers
make contact with your skin,</i>

124
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:41,653
<i>they shoot out venomous spines
that paralyze you.</i>

125
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:45,157
If we get caught, there's a good chance
we won't make it out alive.

126
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:47,284
Even if you die, I'll resurrect you!

127
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:48,285
Listen...

128
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:50,329
Fine. I'll go.

129
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,790
Senshi, let me borrow your helmet.

130
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,296
Laios, you shouldn't do this!

131
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:02,257
You shouldn't count
on the success rate of resurrection magic.

132
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:03,509
It's going to be okay.

133
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:07,387
Because you and Senshi
are who I'm counting on.

134
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:12,059
- Huh? What did he mean by that?
- I don't know.

135
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,143
All right.

136
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:15,395
Hey! Over here, Tentacles!

137
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,817
Ow!

138
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:23,320
They're piercing me through my armor,
just as I feared.

139
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,823
My arms are already going numb.

140
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,200
But...

141
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,327
What on earth are you doing, Laios?

142
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:31,536
Target its midsection!

143
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:32,454
Its midsection!

144
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,634
Dammit.

145
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:46,718
<i>So that's what he meant!</i>

146
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:50,013
<i>He gave me the trickiest task!</i>

147
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,063
Kiki!

148
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,612
Laios, are you okay?

149
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,409
I guess not.

150
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,831
Wait, what?

151
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:18,375
Oh, Kiki. What happened to you?

152
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,294
I'll heal you right away.

153
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,464
This is going to be a little tricky.

154
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,050
Sorry, this might take a while.

155
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,427
Take your time.

156
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:32,055
Is it just me,
or does your face look different?

157
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:34,057
I got stung by a Tentacles.

158
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,977
What should I do about this?

159
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,062
Why are you grasping that?

160
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:42,232
When I tore it off, my hand went numb,
and now I can't let go.

161
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:44,651
Your hand looks like a gnome's now.

162
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,986
Let me see.

163
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,530
Ivy Tentacles, huh?

164
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,742
"Rinsing it with vinegar can reduce
some of the stingers' activity."

165
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:55,454
"It can have the opposite effect
depending on the species of Tentacles,

166
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:56,496
so proceed with caution."

167
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,500
"Make a cross-shaped incision
in the cross-section and peel vertically

168
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,878
to remove the outer layer
with the stingers."

169
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:06,882
TENTACLES WITH VINEGAR DRESSING

170
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:08,800
Apparently, it tastes pretty good.

171
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,926
Are you joking?

172
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,512
No, it's just a fun fact...

173
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,265
If that's the only way,
then I have no other choice.

174
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:16,516
What?

175
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,478
I see. It's not bad.

176
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:22,230
If prepared right,
it'll be even more delicious.

177
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,649
Let me have a bite, too!

178
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,902
This...

179
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:29,696
tastes different depending on the part!

180
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,406
You're definitely imagining it.

181
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,116
No, it's true!

182
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:34,159
Try it.

183
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,914
It only tastes like vinegar.

184
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,208
Do you want a bite, too, Marcille?

185
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,876
Huh? What is it?

186
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:46,213
It tastes sour.

187
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,256
It's kinda gooey.

188
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:51,676
- It's taro root. Tell me it's taro root.
- You, too, Namari.

189
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:54,096
This part. I recommend this part.

190
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:55,722
No! No, thanks!

191
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,433
We're not lacking food!

192
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:00,310
It tastes good, though.

193
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,188
Not quite,
but it could be if prepared right.

194
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,982
Either stew it or mash it and then fry it.

195
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:07,442
Sounds good!

196
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,362
It slipped off!

197
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,325
Sorry for the wait.

198
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,910
I'll treat you now.

199
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,328
Thank you.

200
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,956
Well then, please heal her first.

201
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:30,465
<i>Ilava Rietge Atheus Pilitos
Nuswera Iboiseme Seus Wehrba.</i>

202
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:37,681
It feels awesome being in good health!

203
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:41,059
Thank you, Mr. Tansu.

204
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:41,977
You, too, Laios.

205
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:44,354
What's with your face?

206
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,856
Thank Namari instead.

207
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:46,773
What?

208
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:50,068
Your marksmanship was truly remarkable.

209
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:52,279
It's amazing you took it down
with just one shot.

210
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,574
We're lucky you're skilled
with a crossbow, too.

211
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:58,618
Actually, it was my first time using one.

212
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,536
What?

213
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:01,204
Namari.

214
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:05,876
Thanks for giving us a hand.

215
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,878
I'll set aside the incident
with Falin for now.

216
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:10,213
You're most welcome.

217
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:15,010
Getting paid makes you give it your best,
more so than doing it for free.

218
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,390
Now, now, you two.

219
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,933
It's all in the past now.

220
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,560
It totally isn't!

221
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,314
Why are you, of all people,
acting like it's none of your business?

222
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,690
Unbelievable!

223
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,901
- That's not what I meant!
- Are you the leader?

224
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,486
Tough role, huh?

225
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,282
It's looking this way.

226
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,951
Is it still upset?

227
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:43,663
What did you do
to make the spirit so furious?

228
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:46,082
I've never been attacked by one
so fiercely before.

229
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:49,628
I may have accidentally poured
boiling water directly onto it.

230
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:52,797
That's not good. Typical of an elf.

231
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:54,466
Elves...

232
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,843
My race has nothing to do with it!

233
00:12:57,427 --> 00:13:01,223
Is there a way to pacify the spirit
without using magic?

234
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,599
That's simple.

235
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,977
<i>An Undine is a collective of tiny spirits.</i>

236
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:09,272
<i>If the individuals comprising it
naturally dies off,</i>

237
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:12,359
<i>their hostility will fade away
as new generations emerge.</i>

238
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:16,530
The lifespan of a spirit
is a week at most.

239
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,365
A week?

240
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:20,784
I can't wait that long.

241
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,369
Neither can we.

242
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:25,997
So, we will return to the surface for now.

243
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:28,833
We'll resume our investigation
another time.

244
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,461
Hey, let's prepare the return spell.

245
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:35,382
Hey, Laios.
They're preparing the return spell.

246
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,969
Mr. Tansu, I have a favor to ask you.

247
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:43,515
You want me to return
to the surface with them?

248
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,809
Now? After coming all this way?

249
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,144
You're currently out of magic.

250
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:51,273
I've heard that running out of magic
is similar to having anemia.

251
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:54,192
You should head back to the surface
with Mr. Tansu's party.

252
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:55,443
I'm fine.

253
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:57,529
I'm actually quite surprised
by how great I feel.

254
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,239
Oh, I think it might be due to the liver.

255
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,409
Eating nutritious food won't result
in immediate changes to your condition.

256
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,369
- It's one's daily--
- I'll listen to that later.

257
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,830
I really feel fantastic.

258
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,457
I think some of my magic returned as well
after a short rest.

259
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:14,296
But your staff doesn't seem
to have the usual magical aura.

260
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:16,590
T-That's because...

261
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:20,552
Let's leave her.

262
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:23,138
Why are you laughing?

263
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:26,558
It's just that I've never seen you
with that expression before.

264
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,059
But...

265
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:30,478
what are you going to do
when you're on your own?

266
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:33,273
The three of you
can't fight a dragon by yourselves.

267
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,066
Don't count me in.

268
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:40,780
Plus, that axe of yours doesn't seem like
it could harm a dragon in the slightest.

269
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:46,328
Namari, you've defeated
many dragons, right?

270
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,204
Yeah.

271
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,707
Well then...

272
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:54,461
Please, Namari.

273
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,087
Rejoin our party!

274
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:57,964
Are you serious?

275
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:01,593
Help Laios' party defeat the Red Dragon.

276
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:04,054
I want to rescue Falin, no matter what!

277
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:05,930
Just this once!

278
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,058
I'll find a way to gather the funds!

279
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:09,768
Forget it, Marcille.

280
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:11,603
Why?

281
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:14,064
The adventurer community is small.

282
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:16,775
Gossip travels like wildfire.

283
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:20,362
Namari has been having
financial problems for some time now.

284
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:23,448
And you got wind of it,
didn't you, Mr. Tansu?

285
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:24,407
I did.

286
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:27,994
Now, imagine if she rejoined
her former party for money.

287
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:31,247
<i>"She'll do anything for the right price."</i>

288
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,875
<i>That's what people will say about her.</i>

289
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,253
<i>It may open up more job opportunities,</i>

290
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:39,506
<i>but it'd probably attract
a different clientele.</i>

291
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,424
So, forget it.

292
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:43,885
Especially if you care
about both your futures.

293
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,721
That's how it is.

294
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,515
Forget it, Marcille.

295
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:59,776
No. There's still another way.

296
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:02,529
There's another way for me
to regain my magic.

297
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,531
W-What is it?

298
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,408
I drink...

299
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:08,284
the Undine!

300
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:11,746
What? The Undine?

301
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:14,249
What's with your reactions?

302
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:15,917
Where's your usual enthusiasm?

303
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:17,919
I'm not so interested in spirits.

304
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,880
Spirits live on magic.

305
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,925
I'm certain they're abundant
in magical energy!

306
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:28,096
<i>Capturing it seems trickier
than defeating it, though.</i>

307
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:33,101
But water spirits are vulnerable to heat,
so maybe I can use that.

308
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:35,770
Maybe we can attack it
with a heated weapon.

309
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:40,900
Or maybe we can pour oil on the lake,
set it on fire, and trap the spirit?

310
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:45,447
When it attacks, it spills on the ground,

311
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:47,115
and maybe I could quickly drink that.

312
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:51,494
It'd probably poke holes
in your body from the inside.

313
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:52,746
You're right.

314
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:55,373
Come on, think.

315
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:56,499
There must be a way.

316
00:17:00,962 --> 00:17:03,298
By heating this pot
and using it as a shield,

317
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:05,008
I could defend and attack simultaneously.

318
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:07,594
Undines are powerful enough
to penetrate a stone column, though.

319
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,637
You think that shabby pot can protect you?

320
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:12,140
It's unfair to call it a shabby pot.

321
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:15,769
It's a family heirloom that's been
passed down through generations.

322
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,146
I have diligently maintained it.

323
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:21,066
It never gets burnt
and it distributes heat evenly.

324
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:22,650
It's an exceptional pot.

325
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:24,402
Hold on.

326
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,156
The color, the sheen,

327
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,326
the weight, the texture...

328
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:33,411
This is adamant!

329
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,871
Unbelievable.

330
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:36,915
As a weapon,
it can shatter a dragon's bone.

331
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:38,958
As armor,
it shields even against a dragon's fangs.

332
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:43,421
Adamant, the metal
that every blacksmith dreams of.

333
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,423
So, why is it used for a pot?

334
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:49,094
It was originally a shield,
but I had no need for it, so...

335
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:51,054
How can you be so wasteful?!

336
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,306
Do you think it could withstand
an Undine's assault?

337
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,599
Of course, it could!

338
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,976
We happen to have both a pot and a lid,

339
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,729
so two of us can wield one each
to attack it from both sides...

340
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,816
And we'll burn it with fire!

341
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,609
It's the only option we have.

342
00:18:06,027 --> 00:18:06,861
<i>Really?</i>

343
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:09,948
<i>Even if they have tough shields,
the Undine is so powerful.</i>

344
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:14,661
<i>Maybe the dwarf could restrain it,
but is Laios strong enough?</i>

345
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,876
Brace yourself as soon
as the surface starts to warp.

346
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,338
Let's not waste this opportunity.

347
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:29,968
Here comes!

348
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:32,929
Laios!

349
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:42,689
<i>What incredible power!</i>

350
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:51,698
Laios!

351
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,585
Namari...

352
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:16,806
Now!

353
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:26,816
Good. Keep going.

354
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:28,443
Hang in there!

355
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,320
Place it over the flames!

356
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:55,094
So hot!

357
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,513
- Wow, this is amazing!
- Incredible.

358
00:19:57,513 --> 00:19:59,474
What astounding strength!

359
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,019
Namari, Senshi, thank you so much!

360
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,729
You, too, Laios.

361
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,314
Are you okay?

362
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:08,650
Despite his physique, he's pretty flimsy.

363
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,276
Just like a typical tall-man.

364
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,861
Right.

365
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,580
No need to drink it all in one go.

366
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:26,042
Spirit magic is hard to absorb.

367
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,798
It's fundamental to pair nutrition
with something that aids in absorption.

368
00:20:32,382 --> 00:20:33,549
Senshi.

369
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:36,010
Let's start cooking.

370
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:41,933
<i>Peel the potatoes, carrots,
onions, and the Tentacles.</i>

371
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,018
<i>Then cut them into bite-sized pieces.</i>

372
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:47,563
<i>Marinate the Kelpie meat
with salt and pepper,</i>

373
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,774
<i>and fry until the surface changes color.</i>

374
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:52,568
<i>Add the onions and carrots
and sauté them together,</i>

375
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:54,612
<i>then put them into the Undine.</i>

376
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:58,324
<i>Skim well,</i>

377
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,953
<i>then add the potatoes
and spices and simmer.</i>

378
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,796
It's done!

379
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:14,340
UNDINE STEW WITH TENTACLES AND KELPIE

380
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,259
Huh? Where did everyone go?

381
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:19,220
They went to continue their investigation
at the tower across the water.

382
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:21,431
We're back!

383
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:23,850
I had no idea there would be so many.

384
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,060
Good thing we dealt with them.

385
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,104
H-Hey!

386
00:21:29,314 --> 00:21:32,108
Would you like to join us for a meal?

387
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,072
Here you go.

388
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:40,241
Looks good.

389
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:42,285
Did you make this, Marcille?

390
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:44,996
Senshi helped a lot.

391
00:21:45,747 --> 00:21:47,415
Here, Namari.

392
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:52,170
You should start eating
instead of serving everyone.

393
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,755
O-Okay.

394
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:08,019
Yes!

395
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:10,146
Some magic is starting to come back.

396
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:12,231
You guys,

397
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,069
did you come this far
while scavenging all this time?

398
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,403
Yup.

399
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:21,449
<i>I was ready to face criticism
for leaving the party,</i>

400
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:24,577
<i>but I never expected
to see them resort to this.</i>

401
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,164
<i>Maybe this is a form of punishment.</i>

402
00:22:34,504 --> 00:22:37,548
<i>It's delicious! The broth
has been infused into the ingredients.</i>

403
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:39,717
<i>How did everything cook so quickly?</i>

404
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:41,052
<i>Is it because of the pot?</i>

405
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:43,638
<i>Could adamant
be a good material for making pots?</i>

406
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:46,265
Senshi, was it?

407
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:49,268
Um, about your axe...

408
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,395
I apologize for making fun of it.

409
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:54,148
It's all right.

410
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:58,277
The truth is, I have no interest
in any blacksmithing work.

411
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,739
I can't distinguish
different types of ore,

412
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:05,451
and my old friends
used to get frustrated with me often.

413
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,997
Namari, we're heading back to the surface.

414
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,960
But you can stay here.

415
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,463
What are you talking about?

416
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,757
Try a bite at least!

417
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:22,218
The texture is a bit odd,
but it tastes quite good!

418
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:23,386
But...

419
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:26,180
I know I can't ask you to trust me...

420
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,767
but I want to be more
than just a hired hand.

421
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,436
I want to be accepted as one of you.

422
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:35,064
I'll work hard.

423
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,453
Frankly, Chilchuck,

424
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:52,123
I thought you'd be the first one
to leave the party.

425
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:55,501
You're not the kind to accept unpaid work.

426
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:56,919
Damn right.

427
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,505
That's why I always insist
on getting paid upfront.

428
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:03,759
But the problem is that I can't walk away
when situations like this arise.

429
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,387
What? You stayed because it was your job?

430
00:24:06,387 --> 00:24:08,598
Not for your friends or friendship?

431
00:24:09,307 --> 00:24:10,641
Listen, Marcille.

432
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,643
Let me tell you something important.

433
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:15,521
Folks who claim
they don't need anything in return

434
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,441
are the least trustworthy in this world.

435
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:21,777
By the way, what's Shuro up to now?

436
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:23,446
No idea.

437
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:25,531
He seemed to have
another contact to reach out to.

438
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,576
But he was so in love with Falin
that he wanted to propose to her.

439
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:31,037
So, he's probably still
desperately searching for her.

440
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:33,831
What? I had no clue.

441
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:35,541
- He's so oblivious.
- Totally.

442
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,543
Look, I get that you guys

443
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:43,174
all care about Falin, but be sure
to make it back to the surface, okay?

444
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:47,470
Namari, you take care, too.

445
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,604
See ya!
